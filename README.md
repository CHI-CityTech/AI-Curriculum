# AI Curriculum Repository

This repository contains structured curriculum materials, assignments, and resources designed to support education and experimentation in artificial intelligence. It is organized into two primary areas of focus:

---

## 📘 Intro to AI

This is a 15-week interdisciplinary general education course designed for students with no prior background in artificial intelligence. The course explores:

- What AI is and how it functions
- Societal, ethical, and cultural implications of AI
- Real-world applications across various disciplines
- Human-AI collaboration and reflective engagement
- Practical tools including journaling, prompt writing, and model interaction

**Key components include:**
- ✅ Full weekly lesson plans with integrated reflection activities
- 🧠 Semester-long AI Reflection Journal assignment
- ✍️ In-class writing and revision with AI feedback
- 🧭 Activities on ethics, prompt engineering, and low-code model exploration

> 📂 Materials are scaffolded to support inclusive, exploratory learning environments and integrate both speculative and technical engagement with AI.

## 🤝 Collaborative AI in BBS

This section supports ongoing development of the **Collaborative AI in the Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework. This work focuses on:

- AI as a creative partner rather than a tool
- Mediation pathways between humans and AI across physical and virtual spaces
- Interdisciplinary projects (arts, engineering, humanities) using BBS syntax
- Blended Reality Performance Systems (BRPS) and AI-enhanced storytelling

> 📌 This area is actively expanding. Expect tools, conceptual models, collaborative research templates, and experimental use cases to be added continuously.

## 🧰 Reusable Assignments & Resources

This repository also includes standalone materials that can be used across courses or project-based learning environments:

- 📝 AI Ethics Case Studies & Role-Play Scenarios
- 🎯 Prompt Engineering Templates & Exercises
- 🗂️ Journal & Reflection Frameworks
- 🧪 Project Scaffolds for Model Interaction (including Teachable Machine)
- 🎓 Final Project Guidelines for interdisciplinary AI exploration

---

## 🚧 In Development

We are currently working on:
- Additional Collaborative AI case studies
- Sample projects using the BBS framework
- Faculty guides for AI-enhanced teaching
- A GitHub-based assignment tracker with AI integration reporting
