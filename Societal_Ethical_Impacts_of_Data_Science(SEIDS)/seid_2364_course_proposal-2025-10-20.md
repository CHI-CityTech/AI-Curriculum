# **Course Proposal: Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science (SEID 2364)**

## **Abstract**

This proposal outlines the design, schedule, and theoretical rationale for the *Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science (SEID 2364)* course to be offered at Modul University Vienna in Spring 2026. The course is designed as a blended, multi-modal learning environment aligning with both Modul and City Tech (CUNY) academic calendars. It integrates direct and remote instruction, using communication modality itself as a site of ethical inquiry. Within this structure, students experience diverse modes of mediated communication—face-to-face, synchronous online, asynchronous collaboration, and AI-mediated interaction—allowing them to explore ethical and societal issues experientially. The Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework provides a systematic language for analyzing these interactions, enabling learners to describe, critique, and design responsible systems across physical, virtual, and conceptual domains.

## **The Case for a Multi-Modal Pedagogical Delivery Strategy**

The proposed delivery model for *Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science (SEID 2364)* is designed to **maximize student engagement across diverse communication pathways** rather than adhere to conventional delivery modes. This strategy extends beyond the traditional fully face-to-face course format, offering a dynamic framework that better reflects how communication actually occurs in digital and data-driven environments.

The aim is to provide students with **direct experiential access to multiple mediation environments**—from formal instruction to informal peer collaboration, from human–human and human–machine communication to algorithmically mediated interactions. Students will not only work within these modalities but also **analyze their ethical and societal implications** as part of the course inquiry.

This multi-modal design accomplishes several key goals:

1. **Experiential engagement.** Students actively participate in multiple communication environments and reflect on how each affects behavior, responsibility, and perception.
2. **Relevance to contemporary practice.** By mirroring the diversity of communication systems in real-world data science, the course situates ethical learning within authentic contexts.
3. **Ethical reflection in context.** Each communicative channel becomes an object of inquiry, allowing students to assess ethical implications directly within the environments they use.
4. **Student-led exploration.** Learners are encouraged to identify the communication platforms and tools that shape their own digital experience and to critique them through ethical and societal lenses.

This structure provides students with a **richer, more realistic understanding of the mediated conditions** under which modern computation and data exchange occur. It treats communication as both method and material—**a living laboratory for ethical analysis**.

For Modul University, this approach represents an evolution of blended pedagogy: a model that not only integrates technology but also examines it critically. It aligns with the university’s commitment to innovative, reflective teaching and positions this course as a **prototype for ethically grounded, multimodal education** in the data sciences.

## **2. Pedagogical and Philosophical Framing: Communication as the Foundation of Ethical Understanding**

Contemporary computer science does not exist in isolation—it operates within increasingly **complex, mediated communication environments** that blur distinctions between human and machine, local and remote, real and virtual. Every data exchange, algorithmic decision, and interface design is a communicative act carrying ethical consequence.

For this reason, *Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science* is conceived not merely as a theoretical examination of ethics, but as an **experiential study of communication itself**. Students will inhabit and analyze multiple communication modalities—face-to-face, synchronous online, asynchronous collaboration, and AI-mediated interaction—alongside the full spectrum of communicative forms that shape modern digital life:

- **Text-based exchanges**, such as messaging, email, and collaborative coding;
- **Audio and visual communication**, including streaming, conferencing, and image sharing;
- **Social-media ecosystems**, where visibility, anonymity, and amplification collide;
- **Virtual and immersive environments**, where avatars, agents, and synthetic personas blur boundaries of presence and authorship.

Each of these modes introduces distinct **ethical tensions**—privacy and surveillance, agency and representation, authenticity and manipulation—but also varies according to **time and distance**.

- **Real-time** and **face-to-face** exchanges foreground immediacy and accountability.
- **Asynchronous** or **delayed** communication (emails, recorded lectures, algorithmic responses) introduce latency and interpretation gaps.
- **Local** and **remote** interactions challenge empathy and contextual understanding, while **inaccessible** communication—hidden systems, proprietary algorithms—raises issues of opacity and trust.

By experiencing and reflecting on these **temporal and spatial mediations**, students explore how communication itself changes meaning as it travels—how ethical responsibility may dissipate, distort, or transform across different distances and delays.

In this design, learning becomes both **content and method**. Students analyze ethical dilemmas while simultaneously living within the mediated systems that produce them. This metacognitive approach transforms abstract ethical reasoning into **lived ethical practice**, encouraging reflection on how one’s design choices and communicative habits reverberate through blended human–machine networks.

Within this framework, communication becomes the **experimental substrate** of the course—the shared space through which intelligences (human and computational) interact, negotiate, and generate meaning. This embodies the central principle of the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework: that ethics arises only through relationships between intelligences acting within space and time. Understanding those relationships demands fluency across communicative modalities and the capacity to navigate their temporal and spatial dimensions responsibly.

Moreover, **computer science occupies a uniquely intimate position** within this landscape. Unlike most disciplines that merely encounter artificial intelligence as part of cultural life, computer scientists are also **its architects and custodians**—responsible for creating, managing, and safeguarding systems that mediate human experience across every scale of distance and duration. The ethical responsibilities of this field are therefore both **personal and systemic**, requiring practitioners to engage critically with the communicative and philosophical dimensions of their own designs.

Through this blended, multimodal structure, students come to understand that **ethical awareness in computer science is inseparable from communicative awareness**—that to act responsibly within computational systems, one must first grasp how meaning, intention, and consequence **travel through mediated space and time**, linking human and machine intelligences in the continuum of the digital world.

## **3. Toward a Systematic Language of Mediation and Collaboration**

Understanding the societal and ethical dimensions of data science requires more than abstract moral reasoning; it demands a **formal language** capable of describing how interactions actually occur across human and computational systems. Every communicative act—whether between people, between machines, or between humans and machines—follows a recognizable structure of **exchange, transformation, and interpretation**. Without a systematic way to represent these structures, ethical analysis remains anecdotal rather than analytical.

The **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework provides this language. It offers a unified model for describing **any possible interaction or collaboration** within physical, virtual, and conceptual environments. In BBS, all communication is understood as the movement of information through **space and time**, shaped by distance, latency, and mediation. The framework defines consistent, symmetrical principles that apply equally to human and computational intelligences, treating both as co-participants in communication rather than as hierarchically ordered entities.

In practice, BBS gives students three essential tools:

- A **vocabulary** for identifying the roles of **Source**, **Vector**, and **Destination** within an interaction;
- A **grammar** for describing how signals transform and translate across media and modalities;
- And a **syntax** for mapping these relationships visually and logically—revealing how data, intent, and effect are mediated through different spaces.

Within *Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science*, BBS functions as both a **structural scaffold** and a **reflective practice**. Students use it to chart ethical complexity within real-world data systems—examining how information moves, how agency is distributed, and where responsibility resides. In doing so, they learn that every algorithmic or design decision is itself a communicative act—an expression of intent and influence within a blended ecology of human and artificial intelligences.

Through this model, the course connects technical literacy, communicative awareness, and ethical reflection into a single, coherent framework—preparing students not only to interpret existing systems but to design future ones responsibly.
