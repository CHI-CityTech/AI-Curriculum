# **Research Methodologies Glossary – SRDMPA Framework and Associated Terms**

This glossary defines the core terminology and process stages for research and creative inquiry used across CHI, BBS, and Modul-based projects. It accompanies the **Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science** course and related research or capstone activities, describing the full methodological cycle from speculation to assessment.

## **1. The SRDMPA Cycle (Process Model)**

**Speculate** – The generative and imaginative stage of inquiry. Researchers identify possibilities and frame hypotheses or artistic propositions without immediate concern for feasibility. Establishes conceptual or philosophical direction.

**Research** – The stage of investigation and evidence-gathering. Divided into two modes:
- **Speculative Research** – Exploration based on intuition, personal knowledge, or emergent trends.
- **Precedent Research** – Examination of existing literature, technical precedent, or cultural context.

**Design** – Translating insights into actionable structures, models, or systems. Design involves mediation mapping, problem framing, and symmetry testing across spaces or intelligences.

**Make (Produce)** – The production stage, creating artifacts, prototypes, or experimental environments that embody the conceptual and design work. Includes both physical and virtual realization.

**Publish** – Disseminating outcomes for critique and replication. This includes documentation, presentations, or performances and aligns with open-science and open-education practices.

**Assess** – Evaluating the results using qualitative and quantitative criteria. Assessment identifies emergent behaviors, evaluates symmetry and balance, and determines future refinements.

## **2. Methodological Principles**

**Holistic Integration** – The methodological principle that research, design, and production are interdependent and cyclic, not linear. Each stage informs the others.

**Iterative Development** – The repeated process of making and testing to refine concepts, functionality, and theoretical integrity.

**Cross-Disciplinary Synthesis** – Combining methods from multiple domains (engineering, arts, data science, design) to address complex blended problems.

**Reflexivity** – Awareness of one’s own role, bias, and perspective in the research process. In BBS-based projects, reflexivity parallels recursive system modeling.

**Transparency** – The practice of documenting methods, assumptions, and data so others can reproduce or critique results.

**Reproducibility** – The ability for others to replicate findings using the same methods or datasets.

**Validation** – The process of testing whether research outputs meet defined objectives, whether qualitative (interpretive) or quantitative (numerical).

**Ethical Accountability** – Ensuring that research respects participants, environments, and cultural contexts; extends beyond compliance to behavioral ethics.

**Elegance (Methodological)** – Achieving maximal explanatory or functional power with minimal unnecessary complexity.

## **3. Research Modalities and Approaches**

**Quantitative Research** – Involves measurement, numerical analysis, and statistical validation. Used for system evaluation and modeling.

**Qualitative Research** – Involves interpretation, meaning-making, and contextual understanding. Applied to narrative, social, and design-based inquiries.

**Mixed-Methods Research** – Combines quantitative and qualitative strategies to triangulate insight.

**Practice-Based Research** – Research conducted through the act of making; common in art, design, and technology innovation.

**Ethnographic Inquiry** – Study of behaviors, practices, and cultural systems through observation and participation.

**Critical Design** – Using design artifacts or systems to provoke reflection on social, ethical, or technological issues.

**Participatory Design** – Engaging stakeholders and users in the creation process to ensure inclusivity and shared agency.

**Computational Simulation** – Using models or algorithms to represent and test hypotheses about dynamic systems.

## **4. Documentation and Communication Terms**

**Research Proposal** – A structured plan outlining objectives, context, and methodology for a project.

**Abstract** – A concise summary of purpose, method, and outcome.

**Annotated Bibliography** – A curated list of sources with critical commentary on their relevance.

**Diagrammatic Representation** – Visual communication of relationships, mediation pathways, or systemic interactions.

**Dataset Documentation (Metadata)** – Structured description of data provenance, format, and context.

**Process Log / Journal** – Sequential record of actions, reflections, and decisions during the research process.

**Presentation / Publication Artifact** – Any final communication output — paper, poster, exhibit, or digital artifact.

---

## **5. Assessment and Reflection Terms**

**Formative Assessment** – Feedback occurring during a project to guide improvement.

**Summative Assessment** – Evaluation at the end of a project or cycle to measure learning outcomes or success criteria.

**Rubric** – A structured assessment tool defining performance levels and criteria.

**Critical Reflection** – Analysis of what worked, what failed, and why; emphasizes learning through evaluation.

**Outcome Mapping** – The process of linking activities and outputs to intended outcomes and impacts.

**Feedback Loop** – Mechanism through which results of an action modify future actions — both a methodological and ethical structure.

**Post-Mortem Review** – Structured reflection conducted after project completion to identify transferable lessons.

### **Usage**
This glossary supports students and faculty conducting research or creative production under CHI, Modul, or partner institutions. It serves as the process-language companion to the **BBS Glossary**, ensuring that conceptual and procedural vocabularies remain distinct yet interoperable.
