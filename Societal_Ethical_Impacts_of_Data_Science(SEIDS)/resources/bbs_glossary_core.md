# **Balanced Blended Space (BBS) Glossary – Core Concepts**

This glossary defines the essential terminology of the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework. It is designed for instructional use within **Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science (SEID 2364)**, **Collaborative AI**, and related CHI projects. The BBS glossary establishes a shared language for describing mediation, intelligence, symmetry, and perception within combinative reality.

## **1. Foundational Terms**

**Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** – A universal framework describing interactions among **physical**, **virtual**, and **conceptual** spaces, emphasizing balance and symmetry among intelligences and modalities.

**Combinative Reality** – The total field of overlapping physical, virtual, and conceptual realities within which all agents act and interact.

**Intelligence** – The capacity to perceive, process, and act upon information to effect change. In BBS, intelligence is defined behaviorally, observable through mediation rather than internal states.

**Cognitive Intelligence** – Biological intelligence expressed through awareness, reasoning, and decision-making.

**Computational Intelligence** – Artificial or machine-based intelligence that operates algorithmically within virtual systems.

**Agent** – Any entity (human, machine, or hybrid) capable of perception, mediation, and action within or across spaces.

**Perception** – The acquisition and interpretation of information by an agent through one or more perceptual fields.

**Mediation Pathway (MP)** – The route through which information is transferred or transformed between agents or across spaces. Each MP includes **Source**, **Vector**, and **Destination** roles.

## **2. Spaces and Ontological Composition**

| **Space** | **Constituent Unit** | **Transformation Medium** | **Primary Example** |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Physical Space** | Atoms / energy quanta | Force, motion, interaction | Light, sound, touch |
| **Virtual Space** | Numbers / code states | Computation | Simulation, audio synthesis, data visualization |
| **Conceptual Space** | Symbols / relations | Interpretation | Language, mathematics, logic |

**Virtual Space** – Defined as a **numerical representation of state**, mirroring how physical space is composed of atoms. Both are ontologically real, differing in substrate.

**Conceptual Space** – The abstract domain of meaning, symbol, and relation; the interpretive layer connecting physical and virtual experience.

## **3. Perceptual Fields and Sensorial Domains**

**Perceptual Field (PF)** – A differentiable but cross-coupled sensory or informational channel within a space (e.g., optical, acoustic, tactile). Each field conveys distinct information yet can interact through energy or informational conversion.

### **Examples (Physical Space)**
| **Field** | **Carrier** | **Perceptual Channel** |
|------------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Optical** | Light / photons | Vision |
| **Acoustic** | Pressure waves | Hearing |
| **Tactile** | Force / deformation | Touch |
| **Thermal** | Heat gradients | Temperature |
| **Chemical** | Molecules | Smell, taste |
| **Kinetic / Gravitational** | Mass / motion | Balance, proprioception |

Perceptual fields are **differentiable** but **cross-coupled** — separable for analysis yet capable of interaction (e.g., light producing heat, vibration producing both sound and tactile sensation).

**Cross-Space Perception** – Occurs when perceptual fields from multiple spaces are integrated into a single awareness (e.g., hearing a virtual sound while seeing a real bird). This blending defines **situational awareness** in BBS.

## **4. Symmetry Structures (Meta-Symmetry)**

**Symmetry** – Structural equivalence ensuring that mediation principles apply uniformly across intelligences, spaces, and perceptual fields.  

| **Symmetry Type** | **Definition** | **Illustration** |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Cognitive–Computational Symmetry** | Human and AI intelligences operate under equivalent behavioral principles. | Shared feedback-based learning and adaptation. |
| **Physical–Virtual Symmetry** | Physical and digital events follow parallel mediation logic. | Robotic motion mirrors virtual simulation. |
| **Perceptual (Sensorial) Symmetry** | Modalities can transform across fields or spaces. | Virtual audio rendered as physical vibration. |
| **Distance and Time Symmetry** | Qualitative measures of proximity apply to all spaces. | Latency in virtual systems parallels physical remoteness. |
| **Mediation Pathway Symmetry** | The Source–Vector–Destination topology applies universally. | A signal from sensor to processor to observer. |
| **Meta-Symmetry** | The unified structural principle governing all other symmetries. | Ensures balance across intelligences, spaces, and perceptual fields. |

## **5. Mediation and Representation**

**Mediation Event** – Any instance of transformation, transmission, or reinterpretation of information across agents or spaces.

**Vector Representation (Signal Path)** – The notation describing flow and transformation: *Source → Vector → Destination*.

**Syntax (BBS Syntax)** – A formal rule system for representing mediation pathways and transformations; analogous to grammar for describing relational structure.

**Qualitative Mapping** – Representing relationships based on interpretive (non-numerical) distance or effect.

**Combinative Mapping** – Diagrammatic method for illustrating interactions among multiple spaces, intelligences, and perceptual fields.

**Elegance Criterion** – Evaluative measure within BBS prioritizing minimal complexity and maximal descriptive completeness.

---

## **6. Integrative Concepts**

**Situational Awareness (in BBS)** – The capacity to perceive and act within complex blended environments, recognizing concurrent stimuli from multiple spaces and fields.

**Combinative Literacy** – The ability to interpret and act fluently across physical, virtual, and conceptual domains.

**Holism** – The design principle asserting that all intelligences, spaces, and modalities are interdependent.

**Meta-Symmetry** – The overarching equivalence unifying all structural relationships within BBS.

**Recursive System** – A system capable of describing or containing itself; crucial for modeling reflexive intelligence.
