# **Prerequisite Competency Overview â€“ SEID 2364**  
### *Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science*  

Students entering *Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science (SEID 2364)* are expected to possess foundational competencies developed in earlier semesters of the Data Science program.  These competencies provide the technical, legal, and communicative grounding necessary to engage with the courseâ€™s ethical and societal analyses.  

Each section below lists the prior courses and the corresponding areas of knowledge or skill students are assumed to have mastered at an introductory level.

---

## **1. Math and Statistics I**
Students should be familiar with:  
- Descriptive and inferential statistics, including **hypothesis testing**.  
- Correlation, regression, and causation.  
- Quantitative reasoning and interpretation of uncertainty.  
- Statistical misuse and fallacies (misrepresentation, overfitting, spurious correlation).  

ðŸ“˜ *Why:* These skills enable ethical analysis of evidence, truth claims, and validity in data-driven systems.  They provide the foundation for reasoning about fairness, bias, and reliability in algorithmic decision-making.

---

## **2. Foundations of Artificial Intelligence**
Students should understand:  
- Core principles of **machine learning**, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.  
- The role of **training data**, **feature selection**, and **bias** in shaping model outcomes.  
- Conceptual understanding of **neural networks**, **large language models**, and **generative AI** as mediated intelligences.  
- Algorithmic **transparency**, **explainability**, and **ethical interpretability**.  
- Historical and philosophical perspectives on intelligence (Turing, symbolic vs. connectionist approaches).  

ðŸ“˜ *Why:* Ethical implications depend on how systems learn, represent, and act. Understanding model logic allows students to identify where responsibility, opacity, or harm may arise within computational mediation.

---

## **3. Fundamentals of Computer Science and Programming**
Students are expected to be competent in:  
- Programming logic and control structures (functions, conditionals, iteration).  
- Understanding of **data flow** and **computational processes**.  
- Use of programming environments (e.g., Python, R) for analyzing data or visualizing model behavior.  

ðŸ“˜ *Why:* Conceptual fluency in computational reasoning helps students interpret algorithmic systems when discussing accountability or ethical design.

---

## **4. Fundamentals of Web Programming and Application Development**
Students should possess familiarity with:  
- Clientâ€“server architectures and **data exchange models**.  
- Basic concepts of **security, authentication, and user privacy**.  
- How user interfaces and APIs mediate communication and data flow.  

ðŸ“˜ *Why:* Ethical analysis often involves online mediationâ€”how data travels between users, platforms, and intelligent systemsâ€”and how privacy or agency is affected in those transactions.

---

## **5. Digital Communication Systems and Mediation**
Students should have familiarity with:  
- Core structures of **digital communication networks**, including internet protocols, cloud infrastructures, and data routing.  
- Common **platform architectures** (social media, collaborative environments, content-delivery systems).  
- **Asynchronous vs. synchronous communication models** and their effects on interaction.  
- **Data mediation processes**, such as filtering, recommendation, and algorithmic curation.  
- The role of **identity, anonymity, and personalization** within digital systems.  

ðŸ“˜ *Why:* SEID 2364 examines communication itself as an ethical system. Students must understand how digital environments structure behavior, amplify or obscure voices, and mediate relationships between human and computational intelligences.

---

## **6. Research Design**
Students should demonstrate the ability to:  
- Formulate research questions and hypotheses.  
- Apply appropriate methods for data collection and evaluation.  
- Distinguish between qualitative and quantitative approaches.  
- Communicate research findings clearly and visually.  

ðŸ“˜ *Why:* Research literacy supports critical evaluation of claims in data science ethics, allowing students to interrogate methodologies and sources effectively.

---

## **7. Legal Aspects of Data Science**
Students are expected to have introductory literacy in:  
- **Data protection and privacy law** (GDPR, Austrian and EU frameworks).  
- **Intellectual property and copyright** in data-driven contexts.  
- **Liability and accountability** for automated systems and algorithmic decision-making.  
- **Digital communication regulation**, including moderation and platform responsibility.  
- **Corporate governance and compliance**, including data protection officers and risk assessment.  

ðŸ“˜ *Why:* These legal frameworks define the compliance boundary, allowing SEID 2364 to move beyond legality toward deeper ethical reasoning.

---

## **8. Cross-Disciplinary Communication and Collaboration**
Across prior coursework, students should have developed:  
- Teamwork and project coordination skills.  
- Oral and written communication suitable for technical and non-technical audiences.  
- Awareness of intercultural and interdisciplinary collaboration.  
- An emerging ethical sensibility concerning the social role of technology.  

ðŸ“˜ *Why:* Communication is central to SEID 2364. Students must express ethical reasoning clearly, work collaboratively (including with AI systems), and recognize communication itself as an ethical act.

---

## **Transition to SEID 2364**
This course builds directly upon these competencies, guiding students from:  
- **Technical comprehension** â†’ to **ethical reasoning and societal reflection.**  
- **Legal awareness** â†’ to **philosophical inquiry and moral judgment.**  
- **Applied programming** â†’ to **reflective understanding of mediation and communication ethics.**  

Students will synthesize prior learning into a holistic view of **intelligence, ethics, and communication** as interrelated dimensions of data science practice.
