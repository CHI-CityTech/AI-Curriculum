# **Incoming Competencies and Terminology – Societal & Ethical Impacts of Data Science**

This glossary outlines the core competencies and foundational terminology expected of students entering **Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science (SEID 2364)**. These terms draw from prerequisite and recommended first- and second-semester courses within the **BSc Applied Data Science** program, ensuring shared conceptual literacy across mathematics, programming, artificial intelligence, web development, research design, and legal foundations.

## **1. Mathematical and Statistical Competencies**

**Dataset** – A structured collection of data, typically represented in tabular or relational form for analysis or modeling.  
**Distribution** – The pattern of values within a dataset; describes how data points are spread or concentrated.  
**Correlation vs. Causation** – Correlation indicates relationship; causation implies one variable directly influences another.  
**Variance** – The degree to which data points differ from the mean; a measure of dispersion.  
**Outlier** – A data point significantly different from others, potentially indicating noise, anomaly, or new insight.  
**Sample Bias** – Systematic distortion arising from non-representative data samples.  
**Normalization** – The process of adjusting values or formats to enable fair comparison or compatibility.  
**Overfitting** – A modeling error where a statistical or machine learning model captures noise instead of signal.

## **2. Computational and Programming Competencies**

**Algorithm** – A defined sequence of operations or instructions to solve a problem or perform a computation.  
**Function** – A reusable block of code that produces an output from given inputs.  
**Variable** – A symbolic name storing a value or object; foundation of computational logic.  
**Recursion** – A function calling itself to solve subproblems of the original problem.  
**State** – The stored information representing a system’s current configuration or data context.  
**Complexity** – A measure of the computational resources required by an algorithm (time, space, etc.).  
**Data Type** – The nature of a stored value (integer, string, Boolean, etc.) defining possible operations.  
**Model** – An abstraction or formal representation used to simulate or predict outcomes.

## **3. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Competencies**

**Supervised Learning** – A machine learning paradigm where models are trained using labeled data.  
**Unsupervised Learning** – Learning patterns or structures from unlabeled data.  
**Classification** – Assigning inputs into predefined categories based on learned patterns.  
**Regression** – Predicting continuous outcomes based on input variables.  
**Feature** – An individual measurable property or characteristic used by an algorithm.  
**Training Data** – The dataset used to build or tune an algorithmic model.  
**Model Drift** – The degradation of model accuracy as real-world data diverges from training data.  
**Explainability** – The degree to which model decisions can be understood and justified by humans.  
**Bias (Algorithmic)** – Systematic deviation in an algorithm’s behavior due to unrepresentative or flawed training data.

## **4. Web Systems and Application Development Competencies**

**API (Application Programming Interface)** – A structured interface enabling data exchange between software systems.  
**Client–Server Model** – A computing structure where a client requests services and a server fulfills them.  
**Cookie / Session** – Mechanisms for maintaining state and identity in web communication.  
**Data Packet** – A discrete unit of data transmitted across a network.  
**Endpoint** – A defined connection point in a web service or API for sending or receiving data.  
**Encryption** – Encoding data to prevent unauthorized access during storage or transmission.  
**Authentication / Authorization** – Verifying user identity and assigning appropriate access permissions.  

---

## **5. Research and Design Competencies**

**Hypothesis** – A proposed explanation or prediction tested through data analysis or experimentation.  
**Validity / Reliability** – Measures of accuracy and consistency in data collection or analysis.  
**Control Variable** – A factor held constant to isolate the effect of independent variables.  
**Ethics Approval / Informed Consent** – Formal procedures ensuring research subjects understand and agree to participation.  
**Data Integrity** – The accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of stored or transmitted data.  
**Reproducibility** – The ability to replicate results under the same conditions or data inputs.  

---

## **6. Legal and Governance Competencies**

**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** – The primary EU regulation governing personal data protection and privacy.  
**Personal Data** – Any information relating to an identifiable individual.  
**Data Subject** – The individual whose personal data is collected or processed.  
**Consent** – Freely given, informed agreement to data processing.  
**Controller / Processor** – Entities that determine the purpose and means of data processing (controller) or act on behalf of another (processor).  
**Lawful Basis** – Legitimate grounds under which data processing is permitted.  
**Data Minimization / Purpose Limitation** – Principles ensuring only necessary data is collected and used for specific, declared purposes.  
**Accountability / Transparency** – Legal and ethical obligations to demonstrate responsible data handling.  
**AI Act** – EU regulatory framework for artificial intelligence systems, emphasizing risk management and human oversight.

---

## **7. Ethical and Conceptual Readiness**

**Agency** – The capacity of an actor (human or algorithmic) to make choices and enact change.  
**Accountability** – The state of being responsible for decisions and their consequences.  
**Autonomy** – Independence of action or decision-making within defined constraints.  
**Fairness** – The ethical principle that outcomes should not favor or disadvantage groups unjustly.  
**Harm** – Measurable or perceived negative impact on individuals, groups, or systems.  
**Sustainability** – Long-term maintenance of ethical, environmental, and social balance.  
**Situational Awareness** – The ability to perceive, comprehend, and act within complex, multi-agent environments — a precursor to understanding mediation within the Blended Space.

### **Usage**
This glossary will serve as a reference document for both students and faculty, ensuring conceptual continuity between technical, legal, and ethical coursework. It should be reviewed at the start of the semester, with optional diagnostic self-assessment to confirm familiarity or identify areas for refresher support.
