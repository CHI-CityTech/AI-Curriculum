## üß≠ **Overview**
**SEID 2364** explores the societal, cultural, and ethical dimensions of data science. The course examines how intelligent systems shape decision-making, communication, and human values. It is grounded in the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework, which models how ethics and agency operate across human, computational, and institutional systems.

Students learn to recognize ethical ambiguity, analyze complex sociotechnical systems, and construct their own personal ethical frameworks. The course integrates both human‚Äìhuman and human‚ÄìAI collaboration to foster reflective and responsible data practices.

## üéØ **Core Goals**
- Develop literacy in **ethical reasoning**, data governance, and social accountability.  
- Apply the **BBS model** to visualize responsibility and mediation between agents.  
- Engage in case-based learning, including **Quantum Musico**, **EU AI Act**, and **Cultural Heritage & AI**.  
- Build practical experience working with AI collaborators in real-world ethical analysis.

## üìö **Structure and Delivery**
The course uses a **blended, multimodal format** combining:
- **Face-to-Face sessions** (Vienna residencies)  
- **Synchronous online seminars**  
- **Asynchronous reflective activities and AI-assisted dialogues**  
- **Embedded social-media environments** (private Discord/Mastodon labs)  

The semester follows a 14-week sequence progressing from individual inquiry ‚Üí team collaboration ‚Üí AI-integrated practice ‚Üí final ethical synthesis.

## ü§ù **AI and Collaboration Policy**
AI is integrated as both a **tool and a collaborator**. Students are encouraged to use AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, NotebookLM) responsibly, documenting their interactions and reflecting on the ethical implications of their use. All AI participation must be transparent and properly attributed.
