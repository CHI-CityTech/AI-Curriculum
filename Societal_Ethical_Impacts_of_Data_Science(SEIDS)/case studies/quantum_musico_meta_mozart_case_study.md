### **Instructor Preface**

In this case, students are encouraged to **develop a personalized ethical framework**—a set of analytical tools and processes they can apply to evaluate any mediated system or environment. Rather than prescribing a singular moral doctrine, SEID 2364 treats ethics as a method of *inquiry* that enables structured reflection across differing contexts, cultures, and technologies. Students learn to analyze communication, power, ownership, and responsibility by systematically mapping mediation pathways using BBS principles. This approach recognizes that ethics are culturally embedded and often contested, requiring flexible reasoning and awareness of diverse value systems.


*Quantum Musico: The Meta-Mozart Ethics Experiment* is one of several **illustrative case studies** in SEID 2364, designed to surface ethical complexities and stimulate discussion across multiple domains of data science and artificial intelligence. This case serves as a  **philosophical and practical exploration** that invites students to analyze, debate, and formulate their own positions on ethically complicated territory.

Through this scenario, students explore their own **internal ethical guidelines**, recognizing that ethics is not formally universal but deeply intertwined with **cultural context, historical perspective, and disciplinary framing**. By examining how music, humans, data, and AI intersect across time, this case establishes the challenge of establishing a single, unified ethical framework in a world where values and norms differ across communities and epochs.

The case provides a foundation for considering broader regulatory and societal frameworks, including the **EU AI Act**, which will be explored in subsequent case studies. Students will grapple with questions such as:

- *Who owns what part of what?* — identifying layers of ownership, attribution, and moral responsibility.
- *How do ethical obligations differ between living and deceased creators?*
- *When does preservation become appropriation, and when does transformation become exploitation?*

By situating these questions within the BBS model, students can trace how communication, authorship, and accountability evolve across time, intelligence, and mediation. The *Quantum Musico* example thus becomes a **living laboratory for ethical reasoning**, preparing students to navigate contemporary debates in AI ethics, cultural heritage, and computational creativity.

# **Case Study: Quantum Musico and the Meta-Mozart Ethics Experiment**

## **Abstract**

This case study explores the ethical and philosophical dimensions of the *Quantum Musico* project, an experimental compositional and analytical system that uses artificial intelligence, probabilistic modeling, and quantum computation to generate new musical works inspired by classical heritage. The focal scenario examines the development of a "Meta-Mozart" Large Language Model (LLM) trained on Mozart’s public-domain corpus, AI-generated improvisations ("i.provisations"), and contributions from living composer-performers. The discussion situates this within the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework, emphasizing the symmetry of intelligences across time and space and the ethical responsibilities inherent in creating, transforming, and redistributing cultural signals.

## **1. Framing: Quantum Musico as Temporal Collaboration**

In *Quantum Musico*, music is treated as an **active field of mediation** among intelligences — human, artificial, and historical. The system models composition as a probabilistic process, where each act of musical creation represents a quantum-like collapse of potential into realized sound. Within the BBS framework, this establishes a dynamic network:

> **Mozart (Historical Source)** \u2192 **Corpus & Tradition (Vector)** \u2192 **Quantum Musico System (Computational Source)** \u2192 **Composer/Audience (Destination)**

Here, Mozart is not a static reference but a **temporal signal**, reinterpreted through new mediations. When an AI model re-embodies Mozartian traits, it becomes a participant in a long, multi-intelligence dialogue that spans centuries. The ethical question becomes: *What does it mean to collaborate with the dead?*

In this framing, the project tests how meaning, agency, and responsibility persist when creative signals are stored, recontextualized, and re-emitted across temporal and computational boundaries.

## **2. From Mozart to Meta-Mozart: The Construction of a Layered Intelligence**

The *Meta-Mozart* model represents the next evolution: a composite intelligence trained on three interlinked data sets:

1. **Public-domain Mozart corpus** – authentic historical scores and recordings.
2. **AI-derived i.provisations** – secondary Mozart-like outputs created by earlier Quantum Musico iterations.
3. **Living composer contributions** – contemporary artists composing in the spirit of Mozart.

This creates a recursive LLM that no longer represents a single historical style but an evolving field of *Mozartness*. Over time, the model generates its own stylistic corpus, merging human and artificial influences until the boundary between authentic heritage and synthetic continuation becomes blurred.

The result is an **AI ecosystem of musical style** — a model that continuously reinterprets its own outputs, a feedback system where historical signal, algorithmic mediation, and living interpretation coexist.

## **3. Ethical Dimensions: Public Domain, Living Consent, and Cultural Stewardship**

### **a. Mozart as Cultural Heritage**

Mozart’s works are part of the public domain, a shared inheritance of human culture. Legally, anyone may use, modify, or build upon them. Ethically, however, the act of transforming cultural heritage requires **stewardship** rather than ownership. Key obligations include:

- **Transparency:** disclose data lineage and distinguish original material from synthetic or derivative.
- **Integrity:** avoid false claims of authenticity (e.g., “new Mozart” discoveries).
- **Openness:** ensure the resulting model remains accessible, avoiding re-privatization of the public domain through proprietary weights.

### **b. Living Contributors and Consent**

When living composers contribute to Meta-Mozart, a different ethical framework applies. Their participation requires **explicit consent**, **clear crediting**, and **option to withdraw**. The living bring active agency into the network; thus, the moral obligation shifts from preservation to **relationship ethics**: negotiation, respect, and shared authorship.

### **c. Mixed Data and Provenance Drift**

Once AI-generated material is retrained into the system, provenance becomes opaque. Outputs can no longer be neatly attributed to Mozart, the AI, or the living composers. This creates **attribution stacking** — a cumulative authorship that challenges traditional credit structures. The ethical priority shifts to **traceability**: maintaining records of data lineage, mixture ratios, and decision histories.

### **d. Cultural Equity and Access**

The public domain belongs to all humanity. Ethical AI must not transform open cultural assets into closed corporate resources. Thus, *Meta-Mozart* should adopt open-source licensing, transparent dataset cards, and mechanisms for public access to its generative tools and documentation.

## **4. The BBS Analysis: Temporal and Distributed Responsibility**

In the Balanced Blended Space model, ethics arises through **communication between intelligences in space and time**. Each act of mediation — whether by human, AI, or archival structure — constitutes a moral transaction.

### **BBS Mapping Example:**

| **Role**                | **Agent**                               | **Ethical Responsibility**                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Source**              | Mozart (historical cognitive agent)     | Provide original creative signal; legacy persists through works.          |
| **Vector 1**            | Corpus, editors, archives               | Maintain fidelity and context of transmission.                            |
| **Vector 2**            | AI Model (Quantum Musico / Meta-Mozart) | Transform and reinterpret signal; maintain transparency of mediation.     |
| **Source 2 / Vector 3** | Living composer-performers              | Introduce contemporary perspective; uphold consent and authorship rights. |
| **Destination**         | Listener / Society                      | Interpret meaning; bear ethical awareness of mediation layers.            |

Through this lens, the *Meta-Mozart* system reveals how **ethical accountability distributes across time**, demanding that designers act as curators of communication chains rather than isolated authors.

## **5. Quantum Uncertainty and Ethical Indeterminacy**

*Quantum Musico* operates on probabilistic principles. Its compositions emerge from stochastic sampling and superposition, meaning no two outputs are identical. Ethically, this introduces **creative uncertainty**: each realization represents not only Mozart, but also the algorithm, the human parameters, and chance itself.

This uncertainty parallels **moral indeterminacy** — the impossibility of fully tracing authorship or intention in complex mediated systems. The ethical stance, then, becomes procedural rather than absolute: establish transparent processes, not definitive attributions.

In this respect, *Quantum Musico* models the future of digital ethics: systems where meaning and responsibility are continuously negotiated rather than fixed.

---

## **6. Complexities of Meta-Training and Recursive Models**

The recursive inclusion of AI-generated material introduces several unique complexities:

- **Feedback contamination:** synthetic material reinforces its own biases and artifacts.
- **Authorship inflation:** each iteration multiplies attribution nodes, creating near-infinite lineage.
- **Cultural homogenization:** repeated learning from prior AI outputs compresses stylistic diversity.
- **Transparency loss:** provenance records degrade as datasets compound over time.

Ethical mitigation strategies include:

- Using **adapter-based training** to preserve separable data layers.
- Embedding **metadata provenance tags** to maintain traceability.
- Maintaining **dataset and model cards** describing mixture ratios, sources, and removal policies.
- Offering **public audit access** to verify training lineage.

---

## **7. Ethical Implications of Non–Public-Domain Material**

Including non-public-domain compositions transforms the moral and legal terrain. When protected works are ingested into the model, the ethical focus shifts from cultural stewardship to **active relational ethics**:

- **Consent** must be explicit and documented.
- **Compensation** mechanisms or shared ownership models may be required.
- **Withdrawal rights** must be technically possible.
- **Disclosure** must accompany all uses of derived outputs.

Where public-domain heritage calls for *respectful stewardship*, living heritage demands *reciprocal accountability*.

## **8. Proposed Ethical Framework for Meta-Mozart**

| **Principle**     | **Implementation**                                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transparency**  | Public dataset and model cards with lineage details.                   |
| **Consent**       | Written agreements for all living contributors.                        |
| **Attribution**   | Multi-layered credit acknowledging historical, AI, and living sources. |
| **Accessibility** | Non-exclusive licensing; open-source weights or limited public API.    |
| **Integrity**     | Clear labeling of synthetic vs. authentic material.                    |
| **Reversibility** | Technical ability to remove or disable specific data sources.          |

This framework transforms *Meta-Mozart* from an AI experiment into a **living ethical prototype** — a model for transparent collaboration across time, space, and intelligence types.

## **9. Student Case Study Application (SEID 2364)**

This scenario forms a high-level module for SEID 2364, *Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science*. Students can engage with *Quantum Musico* as an applied example of complex, multi-agent ethics.

### **Learning Objectives:**

- Analyze temporal collaboration and distributed authorship using BBS syntax.
- Differentiate between public-domain, cultural heritage, and living-consent ethics.
- Evaluate model training as an ethical design process.
- Design procedural safeguards for transparency and accountability.

### **Suggested Deliverables:**

- **BBS Mediation Map:** tracing communication between historical, computational, and human agents.
- **Ethical Brief:** written reflection on authorship, consent, and cultural stewardship.
- **Creative Prototype:** small-scale generative system using ethically sourced datasets.
- **Disclosure Document:** public-facing statement summarizing ethical safeguards.

## **10. Philosophical Reflection: When Does Mozart Cease to Be Mozart?**

At its core, the *Meta-Mozart* project asks a timeless ethical question reframed for the age of AI:

> *When does inheritance become invention, and who bears the moral weight of that transformation?*

From a BBS standpoint, the answer is dynamic. *Mozartness* exists not in the corpus, but in the ongoing **transactional relationship between intelligences** — living, artificial, and dead. Ethics in this system are not fixed rules but **procedural commitments** to transparency, respect, and continuity.

In creating the *Meta-Mozart* model, we do not resurrect Mozart; we participate in the continuing evolution of human–machine musical consciousness, accepting that with every new mediation comes renewed ethical responsibility.

---

**Summary:**\
*Quantum Musico* and the *Meta-Mozart* case reveal the emerging frontier of digital ethics: systems that merge heritage and innovation, where public-domain culture becomes a living collaborator and AI becomes both archivist and improviser. Through BBS, students and researchers can map how these interactions extend moral agency across centuries, showing that the future of ethics lies not only in compliance, but in **communication across time.**
