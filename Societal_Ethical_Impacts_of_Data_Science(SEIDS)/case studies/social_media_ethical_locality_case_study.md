### **Instructor’s Note**

*Social Media: Ethical Distance and Virtual Locality* is designed as an **embedded social-media modality experiment**, not a discussion-driven case. It integrates the learning environment directly into the mediation system it studies. Students inhabit and interact within a structured social network (such as Discord or a private Mastodon instance) that becomes both the classroom and the subject of analysis.

This approach turns communication itself into the site of ethical exploration: every post, reaction, and algorithmic intervention becomes a potential ethical event. The instructor acts as moderator, guide, and ethical custodian, helping students navigate the boundaries of privacy, identity, and accountability within a live, mediated environment. AI agents may also participate as provocateurs or reflective partners, expanding the ethical field to include nonhuman collaborators.

The objective is not to describe social media ethics from the outside but to **experience and analyze mediated ethics from within**. Students learn by engaging directly in nested virtual localities—private channels, group servers, and cross-platform contexts—observing how locality, distance, and algorithmic curation affect empathy, moral reasoning, and communication norms. The case therefore functions as a living experiment in **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** ethics, uniting theory, practice, and reflexivity in a single mediated learning environment.

### *SEID 2364 – Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science*

## **Abstract**
This case study examines **social media** as both an ethical environment and a mediation modality, using the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework to explore how communication, identity, and accountability evolve across nested virtual localities. Students analyze how proximity and distance in virtual contexts reshape ethical behavior, responsibility, and empathy. The study emphasizes the fluid nature of *locality* in online systems, where “closeness” is defined not by geography but by shared mediation environments such as Discord, Facebook, or Reddit. Through BBS mapping and reflective inquiry, students engage in constructing an ethical understanding of how distance and community architecture influence moral decision-making.

## **1. Framing: Social Media as a Field of Mediation**
Social media environments function as **dense ethical ecosystems**, where multiple intelligences—human, computational, and algorithmic—interact continuously. Within BBS, these platforms exemplify **transactional symmetry**: users act simultaneously as **Source**, **Vector**, and **Destination** of communication signals. Each interaction—posting, reacting, or sharing—is a micro-ethical act embedded in a vast system of mediated relationships.

**Ethical Inquiry:** How does moral accountability persist when every agent is both speaker and amplifier, both witness and algorithmic signal?  
**BBS Lens:** Mediation pathways define ethical scope; every signal transmission transforms responsibility.

---

## **2. Hierarchies of Virtual Locality**
The idea of *locality* in online communication must be redefined. In physical space, proximity implies empathy and direct accountability. In virtual space, *local* means *within the same mediation topology*. A Discord chat, for example, is “local” to its members but “remote” to those on Facebook—even if they share physical proximity.

### **Nested Localities:**
| **Level** | **Example** | **Locality Type** | **Ethical Dynamics** |
|------------|-------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 0 | Face-to-face encounter | *Embodied Local* | Empathy, immediacy, and visible consequence. |
| 1 | Discord channel | *Micro-local (Relational)* | Intimacy, shared vernacular, bounded norms. |
| 2 | Discord server / Facebook group | *Meso-local (Community)* | Moderation, social cohesion, and moral negotiation. |
| 3 | Platform (Discord / Facebook) | *Macro-local (Systemic)* | Algorithmic governance, visibility control, and decontextualization. |
| 4 | Cross-platform network | *Meta-local (Cultural)* | Translation of ethics between incompatible mediation systems. |

Each layer reshapes how ethical responsibility is perceived. A joke or meme acceptable within a micro-local Discord channel may become harmful when algorithmically surfaced at the macro-local level of Facebook or X (formerly Twitter). This reveals the importance of understanding **ethical boundaries as topological, not geographic.**

## **3. The BBS Mediation Pathway: Cross-Platform Ethics**

**Example:** A user shares a Discord meme that is later reposted on Facebook and discussed publicly.

> **User (Cognitive Source)** → **Discord Channel (Vector 1: relational mediation)** → **Server (Vector 2: community moderation)** → **Platform Algorithm (Vector 3: computational mediation)** → **Facebook Feed (Vector 4: cross-platform transformation)** → **Audience (Destination)**

| **Stage** | **Transformation** | **Ethical Implication** |
|------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Relational → Communal | Context shifts from private to semi-public. | Shared norms fragment; meaning is reinterpreted. |
| Communal → Algorithmic | Visibility becomes machine-determined. | Responsibility becomes diffused; harm may amplify. |
| Algorithmic → Cross-Platform | New audience encounters content without origin context. | Cultural misalignment and moral dislocation occur. |

The ethical consequence is **distributed accountability**—no single participant or system owns the outcome, yet all participate in it.

## **4. Ethical Dimensions of Distance and Proximity**
**Local ethics** emphasize empathy and immediate feedback: you see the effect of your words.  
**Remote ethics** involve abstraction, delay, and diffusion of responsibility.  
**Virtual ethics** blur this boundary—creating the illusion of closeness without true contextual awareness.

Ethical awareness depends on *how the mediation structure constructs distance*:
- **Temporal Distance:** latency between action and consequence (e.g., viral posts).  
- **Perceptual Distance:** anonymity, filters, or avatar embodiment.  
- **Social Distance:** difference in community norms or algorithmic segmentation.  
- **Ethical Distance:** gap between intent and perceived harm.

Students analyze how each of these modulates moral reasoning and behavior.

## **5. Cultural Appropriation and Virtual Locality**
When social media content circulates across different virtual localities, cultural meaning often detaches from its origin. A meme based on Indigenous art, for example, may be reposted without cultural context, transforming respect into appropriation. Ethical responsibility thus extends beyond legal frameworks to include **cultural stewardship**.

Within BBS, this becomes a mapping problem: identifying where cultural signals cross from one ethical topology (e.g., Indigenous Discord community) into another (global meme culture). Students assess who bears responsibility for contextual translation and acknowledgment.

## **6. Pedagogical Integration**
This case study functions as both a theoretical and experiential exploration. Students engage directly with mediated environments to analyze ethical complexity.

**Activities:**  
- Map personal “virtual geography” across platforms, identifying micro- and macro-local ethical spaces.  
- Conduct reflective analysis of a cross-platform interaction.  
- Simulate an ethical miscommunication by transferring a message across nested virtual localities.  
- Discuss cultural appropriation as a form of ethical distance.  

**Deliverables:**  
- **BBS Map of Virtual Locality:** diagram showing ethical pathways between environments.  
- **Reflective Essay:** how proximity, anonymity, and algorithmic curation shape moral behavior.  
- **Case Report:** analysis of an ethical breach arising from virtual distance.

## **7. Broader Implications for Data Science and Society**
Social media represents a living laboratory of **mediated ethics**—a dynamic system where algorithmic and human agents continuously reshape social trust. For data scientists, understanding these ethical dynamics is crucial: they design the vectors that define proximity, attention, and influence.

Questions for reflection:  
- How does design determine what counts as local or remote in digital space?  
- Can algorithmic systems ever maintain ethical transparency when they construct locality dynamically?  
- What responsibility do developers hold for emergent moral phenomena arising from their systems?

---

## **8. Philosophical Reflection: The Ethics of Constructed Proximity**
The moral landscape of the digital world is not flat—it is **layered and topological**. Proximity and distance are engineered states that determine how empathy, outrage, and accountability flow. Within this topology, the goal of ethical reasoning is not merely to close the distance but to **be aware of the mediation itself**.

By studying virtual locality, students learn that ethical awareness is not tied to place but to **alignment of mediation patterns**. In social media, we are only as close—or as responsible—as our communication architectures allow.

---

**Summary:**  
This case study positions social media as both an environment and modality for ethical inquiry. By analyzing nested localities, cross-platform interactions, and cultural translation through the BBS lens, students learn to navigate moral complexity in mediated systems. They emerge better equipped to recognize and evaluate ethical distance—an essential competence in the age of data-driven communication.
