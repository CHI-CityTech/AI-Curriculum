# **Potential Course Modalities – SEID 2364**  
### *Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science*  

This document outlines the range of communication modalities and learning environments available for SEID 2364. The course is designed as an *experiment in mediated ethics*, where students experience and analyze multiple forms of communication—human, machine, virtual, and hybrid—as living case studies in ethical behavior.

---

## **1. Face-to-Face (FTF) Environments**
Direct, in-person sessions held during instructor residencies in Vienna.  

**Examples:**
- Orientation, project launches, and synthesis workshops.  
- Interactive group mapping of ethical systems using BBS diagrams.  
- Mid-semester and final EU AI Act intensives.  

**Ethical Dimension:** Embodied communication, immediacy, empathy, and presence.  
Students experience accountability and shared space as ethical encounters.

## **2. Synchronous Online Modalities (Real-Time Interaction)**
Live digital engagements where participants occupy the same temporal but different spatial context.  

| **Sub-Mode** | **Description** | **Tools / Platforms** | **Ethical Focus** |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| **Classic Video Seminar** | Standard lecture and discussion via video conferencing. | Zoom, Teams, Google Meet | Authority, visibility, and power dynamics of mediated presence. |
| **AI-Augmented Seminar** | Human conversation accompanied by live AI summarization or questioning. | ChatGPT (Teams), Poe Rooms, Zoom GPT | Shared cognition, authorship, and accuracy. |
| **Avatar-Based Virtual World** | Students meet as avatars in 3D or spatialized environments. | Mozilla Hubs, Spatial.io, EngageVR | Identity, embodiment, and consent in virtual space. |
| **Multichannel Discussion** | Simultaneous use of text, audio, and video in layered formats. | Discord, Gather.town | Ethical tone, miscommunication, and immediacy vs. distance. |
| **Collaborative Simulation / Code Lab** | Joint exploration of algorithmic ethics in real time. | JupyterHub, GitHub Codespaces, Google Colab | Shared accountability and experimental transparency. |

## **3. Asynchronous Online Modalities (Distributed and Reflective Interaction)**
Learning activities that unfold over time, allowing for deeper reflection and cross-time collaboration.

| **Sub-Mode** | **Description** | **Tools / Platforms** | **Ethical Focus** |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| **Discussion Threads** | Structured forum-based debates or reflective writing. | Brightspace, GitHub Discussions | Latency, reflection, and sustained accountability. |
| **AI Reflection Logs** | Students maintain conversational journals with AI agents. | ChatGPT, NotebookLM | Self-reflection, personalization, and bias recognition. |
| **Ethical Case Wikis** | Collaborative documentation and revision of case studies. | GitHub Wiki, Notion | Authorship, collective reasoning, and version control ethics. |
| **Video Annotation and Commentary** | Critical analysis of recorded discussions or case material. | Panopto, Loom, Edpuzzle | Retrospection and moral hindsight. |
| **Peer Review Exchanges** | Students assess others' work asynchronously. | Peergrade, Hypothes.is | Evaluating others' ethical frameworks with empathy and rigor. |

---

## **4. Hybrid and Immersive Environments**
Blends of synchronous, asynchronous, and spatially immersive communication designed to evoke complex ethical contexts.

**Examples:**
- **Spatial Classrooms (Mozilla Hubs, Gather.town):** Avatars interact with pinned ethical resources.  
- **Immersive EU AI Act Simulation:** Students explore legal clauses as 3D ethical architecture.  
- **Hybrid Panels:** Some participants local, others virtual, fostering spatial asymmetry.  

**Ethical Dimension:** Distance, latency, and mixed embodiment as metaphors for distributed agency and mediation.

---

## **5. Collaborative AI Environments**
Spaces where human–AI interaction becomes a structured component of learning and ethical reflection.

**Examples:**
- **AI Teammates:** Custom GPTs act as team associates trained on course readings and BBS syntax.  
- **AI Ethics Associates:** Conversational partners representing competing ethical standpoints.  
- **AI Documentation Tools:** Automated summarizers, translators, and feedback agents tracking group mediation.  

**Ethical Dimension:** Co-authorship, distributed responsibility, and emergent moral reasoning.

---

## **6. Integrated Multimodal Design**
Each course unit will combine at least two of these modalities, ensuring that students encounter ethical complexity directly through experience.  

**Example Patterns:**
- *Speculative Week:* FTF + AI Reflection Logs.  
- *Legal Mediation Week:* Virtual World + Discussion Thread.  
- *Identity Week:* Multichannel Seminar + Peer Review.  

**Pedagogical Objective:** To cultivate ethical agility — the ability to recognize and adapt to the ethical conditions implicit in any mode of communication or collaboration.

---

## **Summary**
This multimodal framework positions SEID 2364 as both a course *and* an experiment in blended ethical literacy.  Students will not only study the societal and ethical implications of data science but live them—experiencing how communication modality shapes moral awareness, responsibility, and collaboration across physical, virtual, and computational spaces.
