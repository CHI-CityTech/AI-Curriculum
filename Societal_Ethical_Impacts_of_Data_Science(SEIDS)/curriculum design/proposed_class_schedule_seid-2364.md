# **Proposed Class Schedule – SEID 2364**  
### *Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science (Spring 2026 – Modul University Vienna)*

This schedule outlines a 14-week progression integrating multimodal delivery (FTF, synchronous, asynchronous, and embedded social-media environments), ethical inquiry, and experiential learning using the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework.

- Short reflective essay: **Personal Ethical Compass**.

---

## **Week 3: Communication, Mediation, and Agency**  
**Modality:** Synchronous Online  
**Theme:** *How mediation shapes ethical meaning*  
**Activities:**  
- Live seminar + backchannel text discussion.  
- Exercise: Map a digital communication pathway ethically (Source–Vector–Destination).

---

## **Week 4: Theories of Intelligence and Moral Systems**  
**Modality:** Asynchronous + AI Reflection Logs  
**Theme:** *From Aristotle to Turing to today*  
**Activities:**  
- AI dialogue log: “What would an ethical intelligence value?”  
- Discussion post connecting intelligence theories to moral structures.

---

## **Week 5: Legal Contexts and the EU AI Act (Part I)**  
**Modality:** Synchronous Online (Panel / seminar)  
**Theme:** *Law as ethical mediation*  
**Activities:**  
- Data protection, privacy, and algorithmic transparency overview.  
- Group case: **GDPR vs. AI personalization**.

---

## **Week 6: Cultural Heritage and Ownership Ethics**  
**Modality:** Asynchronous Wiki Collaboration  
**Theme:** *Public domain, intellectual property, stewardship*  
**Activities:**  
- Collaborative case analysis: **Who owns culture?**  
- Build class wiki on cultural/IP ethics.

---

## **Week 7: Legal Contexts and the EU AI Act (Part II)**  
**Modality:** Synchronous Online  
**Theme:** *Regulatory simulation and negotiation*  
**Activities:**  
- Role-play as policy advisors revising an AI Act section.  
- Midterm check-in + project progress report.

---

## **Week 8–9: Ethical Ambiguity and Wicked Problems**  
**Modality:** Asynchronous + Hybrid Discussion  
**Theme:** *When there is no single right answer*  
**Activities:**  
- Case study (e.g., **Quantum Musico**) on distributed agency.  
- BBS mapping of responsibility diffusion.  
- Launch **Ethical Logbook**.

---

## **Week 10: Human–AI Collaboration and Agency**  
**Modality:** Synchronous Online (AI-Human Team Workshop)  
**Theme:** *Designing responsible AI collaborators*  
**Activities:**  
- Teams design/prompt-tune an AI teammate or tool.  
- Debate: **AI as tool vs. partner**.  
- Prepare for embedded social-media lab (norms, consent, privacy).

---

## **Week 11: Social-Media Ethics and Cultural Representation**  
**Modality:** **Embedded Social-Media Environment** (Private Discord + Adjacent Platform Observation)  
**Theme:** *Ethics of representation in mediated social environments*  
**Description:** Students inhabit a structured social-media space that functions as both classroom and ethical laboratory. Each post/reaction/moderation event is analyzed as an ethical act. Students also observe adjacent public platforms (Mastodon/Reddit/X) to compare norms and algorithmic amplification.

**Objectives:**  
- Experience social-media interaction as a moral and cultural field.  
- Evaluate how platform architecture defines proximity, empathy, accountability.  
- Identify and critique cultural appropriation and meme ethics.  
- Apply BBS mapping to track ethical-signal transformations across virtual localities.

**Activities:**  
- Structured discussions within private Discord/Mastodon.  
- Cross-platform observation tasks.  
- Create a **BBS Ethical-Distance Map**.  
- Document moderation and group-norm negotiation as ethical practice.

**Deliverables:**  
- BBS Ethical-Distance Map  
- Reflective essay on empathy, identity, algorithmic influence  
- Group report: **Cross-Platform Ethical Dynamics**

---

## **Week 12: Team Project Development – Mediated Ethics in Practice**  
**Modality:** Hybrid (Asynchronous + Team Collaboration via Embedded Environments)  
**Theme:** *Designing ethical frameworks across modalities*  
**Description:** Teams form around domains (e.g., social-media behavior, algorithmic bias, human–AI collaboration, cultural representation). Each selects a case framework (e.g., **Quantum Musico**, **Social Media Locality**) and extends it via applied research or prototype development. Begin iterative documentation of ethical decisions and mediation mapping.

**Objectives:**  
- Connect theory to applied ethical design.  
- Integrate BBS mapping into project planning.  
- Manage distributed communication ethically across modalities.

**Activities:**  
- Team proposal drafting and ethical focus selection.  
- Early BBS mediation diagram creation.  
- Coordination meetings; shared log development.

**Deliverables:**  
- **Team Proposal Document**  
- **Preliminary BBS Mediation Diagram**  
- **Ethics Journal Entries & Reflection Logs**

---

## **Week 13: Iteration, Integration, and Implementation**  
**Modality:** Team + AI Collaborative (Optional synchronous studio check-ins)  
**Theme:** *Refining mediated ethics frameworks*  
**Description:** Teams test, refine, and present evolving frameworks. AI partners may participate as reflective collaborators. Cross-team feedback highlights the transactional nature of ethical mediation.

**Objectives:**  
- Improve ethical coherence and design based on feedback.  
- Experiment with human–AI collaboration.  
- Evaluate how mediation influences outcomes in real and virtual spaces.

**Activities:**  
- Prototype testing and peer review.  
- Team synthesis presentations.  
- Document ethical adjustments and refinements.

**Deliverables:**  
- **Synthesis Presentation** (oral or recorded)  
- **Updated BBS Diagrams**  
- **Peer Evaluation Report**

---

## **Week 14: Final Reflection and Assessment**  
**Modality:** Face-to-Face (Vienna) or Synchronous Hybrid  
**Theme:** *Meta-reflection and synthesis in ethical mediation*  
**Description:** Students consolidate knowledge across the semester, analyzing how ethical reasoning evolved through multimodal and collaborative experiences.

**Objectives:**  
- Articulate personal/team ethical frameworks informed by BBS.  
- Synthesize insights from all case studies and projects.  
- Critically evaluate one’s own mediated ethical behavior.

**Activities:**  
- Final presentations and discussion.  
- Submission of final reflective portfolios.  
- Course debrief: future ethical challenges in data science.

**Deliverables:**  
- **Final BBS Maps & Reports**  
- **Reflective Portfolio**  
- **Group & Individual Self-Assessment**

---

**Summary:**  
Weeks 11–14 now form an iterative bridge from **embedded social-media ethics** to **team-based development** and **final synthesis**, reinforcing the course’s commitment to multimodal, experiential ethics grounded in BBS.
