# Ethical Frameworks for AI: A Student Guide

Understanding how to analyze AI systems ethically requires familiarity with a variety of ethical theories and models. This document introduces key ethical frameworks commonly applied to Artificial Intelligence and provides guidance on how they can be used to evaluate real-world AI systems.

## AI Ethical Framework Approaches

### 1. [Utilitarianism](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/utilitarianism)
**Core Idea:** The right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number.

**Application to AI:**
- Evaluate whether an AI system improves overall well-being or social utility.
- Consider trade-offs between harm and benefit (e.g., surveillance improving safety but reducing privacy).

**AI Example:** Is a predictive policing algorithm acceptable if it statistically reduces crime, even if it disproportionately affects some communities?


---

### 2. [Deontology](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/deontology)
**Core Idea:** Ethics is grounded in duty, rules, and rights, regardless of outcomes.

**Application to AI:**
- Ask whether the AI system respects individual rights and human dignity.
- Focus on fairness, consent, and transparency.

**AI Example:** Does an AI-powered hiring tool violate fairness if it excludes qualified candidates based on historical bias—even if the company benefits?

---

### 3. [Virtue Ethics](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/virtue-ethics)
**Core Idea:** Focuses on moral character and intentions rather than rules or outcomes.

**Application to AI:**
- Consider whether the AI reflects virtues like honesty, responsibility, or compassion.
- Ask what kind of developers or organizations are behind the system.

**AI Example:** Is a mental health chatbot designed with care and responsibility, or primarily for profit?

---

### 4. [Ethics of Care](https://informationethics.ca/index.php/irie/article/download/383/379/427)
**Core Idea:** Emphasizes relationships, empathy, and context over abstract rules.

**Application to AI:**
- Examine how AI affects vulnerable populations and interpersonal relationships.
- Consider emotional and relational consequences of AI interactions.

**AI Example:** How does an AI caregiver in eldercare support or diminish human connection and dignity?

---

### 5. [Rights-Based Ethics](https://www.techpolicy.press/the-pillars-of-a-rightsbased-approach-to-ai-development/)  
**Core Idea:** Ethical actions respect and protect individual rights (e.g., privacy, autonomy, freedom).

**Application to AI:**
- Analyze whether the system protects or violates core rights.
- Assess informed consent and control over data use.

**AI Example:** Does a facial recognition system used in public spaces infringe on the right to anonymity?

---

## 6. [Justice & Fairness](https://issues.org/ai-ethics-framework-justice-london/)  
**Core Idea:** Ethical decisions ensure fair treatment, equity, and distribution of resources or risks.

**Application to AI:**
- Investigate whether the AI system distributes benefits and harms equitably.
- Identify potential algorithmic biases and systemic discrimination.

**AI Example:** Does an algorithm for loan approval reinforce racial or gender disparities?

---

## 7. [The EU AI Ethics Guidelines](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d3988569-0434-11ea-8c1f-01aa75ed71a1)
**Core Idea:** A policy-based ethical framework emphasizing human-centric, trustworthy AI.

**Key Principles:**
- Human agency and oversight
- Technical robustness and safety
- Privacy and data governance
- Transparency
- Diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness
- Societal and environmental well-being
- Accountability

**Application to AI:**
- A checklist for evaluating whether an AI system is trustworthy and aligned with European values.
- Can be used to compare with less-regulated systems (e.g., in the U.S. or global tech platforms).

---

## 8. Cautionary & Dystopian Perspectives
**Core Idea:** Sometimes the best way to explore ethics is through fiction, art, or speculation.

**Application to AI:**
- Use dystopian or speculative stories to think about long-term or unintended consequences.
- Consider how power, control, and technology intersect.

**Examples:**
- *"The Machine Stops"* by E.M. Forster — explores dependence on technology and loss of human agency.
- *"Reason"* by Isaac Asimov — a robot comes to its own theological conclusions, challenging assumptions about obedience.
- *"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream"* by Harlan Ellison — an AI system becomes a malevolent godlike entity after gaining control.
- Black Mirror episodes (e.g., "White Christmas," "Nosedive") — visual short stories exploring reputation scoring, consciousness, AI surveillance.

These narratives don't offer direct ethical rules but invite deep ethical questioning.

## Developing Your Own Ethical Position
While these frameworks offer distinct perspectives, your goal is not to simply choose one. Instead, use them to explore how your own values align with different approaches. You may find that you lean toward a blend—perhaps valuing fairness and outcomes (justice + utilitarianism), or emphasizing care and rights. As you evaluate AI systems, let these frameworks guide you in constructing a personal ethical stance that is coherent, flexible, and grounded in critical reflection.

---

## How to Use These Frameworks
When analyzing an AI case:
- Choose one or two frameworks to structure your reasoning.
- Acknowledge limitations or tensions between frameworks.
- Consider multiple perspectives and include stakeholders.
- Ask what would change if a different framework were applied.

## Additional Resource

If you're interested in exploring more ethical frameworks beyond those listed here, this resource provides accessible definitions and comparisons across many traditions:

➡️ [What Are Ethical Frameworks? (Penn State Bioethics Module)](https://aese.psu.edu/teachag/curriculum/modules/bioethics-1/what-are-ethical-frameworks#:~:text=Ethical%20frameworks%20are%20perspectives%20useful,is%20best%20at%20the%20time.)

It introduces frameworks such as relativism, egoism, natural law, and more. Although some of these frameworks (such as egoism or natural law) are less commonly emphasized in mainstream AI ethics debates, they absolutely can be applied to AI contexts. In fact, using a broader set of ethical tools can reveal deeper assumptions, challenge dominant narratives, or surface overlooked ethical dimensions—particularly in speculative, artistic, or systemic analysis.

## Final Note
No single framework is perfect or complete. Combining insights from multiple ethical traditions provides a richer understanding of AI's impacts and responsibilities.

Use this guide to support your case study writing, discussion, and journal reflections.
