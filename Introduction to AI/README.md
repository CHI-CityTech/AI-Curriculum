# üìò README: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (LIB 2001ID)

### Instructor-Facing Overview

This repository supports the **interdisciplinary, general education course**:  
**Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (LIB 2001ID)**  
Approved as a **Pathways College Option ‚Äì Interdisciplinary Course**  
**Credits:** 3 | **No prerequisites in computer science**

---

## üß≠ Course Purpose

This course introduces non-CS majors to the conceptual, ethical, historical, and societal dimensions of Artificial Intelligence. The curriculum is designed to build **AI literacy**, foster **critical reflection**, and integrate **hands-on experience** with AI tools ‚Äî all without requiring coding.

The course fulfills general education outcomes and interdisciplinary learning goals while preparing students to critically engage with AI in academic, professional, and everyday contexts.

## üìå Instructor Notes  

- **No coding is required** but students may optionally explore code-based tools.  
- A **dedicated lesson on citing and using AI responsibly** is included in Week 2.  
- The **final project** is flexible: research, creative artifact, or applied case study.  
- The course aligns well with Media Studies, Philosophy, Emerging Media, and Technology programs.

- **AI use is integral to the course design.** Many assignments and in-class activities explicitly **require students to use AI tools** (e.g., chatbot comparisons, machine learning experiments, creative generation). 

- Outside of those required tasks, **students are encouraged to explore AI tools independently** ‚Äî provided they **clearly cite** any AI-generated contributions or assistance.

- A full lesson on **responsible use and citation of AI tools** is included in Week 2, along with guidelines on how to document AI involvement using APA, MLA, and Chicago formats.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Ideal Use Cases

- Taught solo or collaboratively across disciplines  
- Integrates well with **AI ethics**, **media literacy**, **data studies**, and **digital humanities** initiatives  
- Functions as a standalone Gen Ed course or an intro to more technical offerings
