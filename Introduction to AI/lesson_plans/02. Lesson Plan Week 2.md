## Overview
This class session builds upon the foundational knowledge introduced in Session 1, focusing on AI hallucinations, chatbot comparison, historical AI development, and ethical concerns. Students will engage in critical discussions and hands-on activities, utilizing online collaborative tools to enhance learning and interaction.

## Learning Objectives
- Analyze the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated content.
- Compare different AI chatbots based on functionality and effectiveness.
- Explore the historical evolution of AI from rule-based systems to deep learning.
- Identify and discuss ethical concerns, including bias and misinformation in AI.
- Apply AI tools in a controlled experiment to assess their potential and limitations.
- Develop proficiency in using online collaborative platforms for AI-related discussions and activities.

## Materials Needed
- Projector and screen for presentation
- Student-submitted AI-generated content from Assignment 5 (AI Hallucinations Analysis)
- Laptops or mobile devices for chatbot interaction
- Access to multiple AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Bing AI, etc.)
- Online collaboration tools (e.g., Miro, Padlet, Google Docs, Perusall, or Slack)
- A mix of AI-generated and human-created artwork, writing samples, and music

## Schedule

### 1. Opening Poll & Reflection Activity (10 minutes)
- **Online Poll:** Ask students to respond to a quick reflection question via **Google Forms, Padlet, or Poll Everywhere**:
  - "Can AI be truly creative? Why or why not?"
  - "What is the biggest challenge you see with AI today?"
  - "Would you trust an AI-generated piece of art, writing, or music over a human-created one? Why?"
- **Live Response Discussion:** Briefly review poll responses and highlight major themes.
- **Attendance Check:** Participation in the poll serves as an organic way to confirm student presence.

### 2. Review of Previous Session (15 minutes)
- Recap key concepts from Session 1.
- Address any lingering questions.

### 3. Student Reflections on Assignments (20 minutes)
- Students share insights from their assignments on AI in daily life and AI-generated hallucinations.
- Discuss common themes and surprising discoveries.
- Use **Google Docs or Perusall** for students to annotate key takeaways collaboratively.

### 4. Exploring AI Hallucinations & Identifying AI vs. Human-Created Content (20 minutes)
- Display selected AI-generated content that contained hallucinations.
- Analyze patterns in errors and discuss the implications of unreliable AI-generated information.
- Use **Google Docs or Perusall** for students to annotate AI-generated content with their insights.
- **Activity:** Challenge students to distinguish between AI-created and human-created content in different mediums:
  - Writing samples (e.g., essays, poetry)
  - Visual art (e.g., AI-generated paintings vs. real artwork)
  - Music (e.g., AI-generated compositions vs. human-composed pieces)
- Discuss findings and explore how AI mimics human creativity.

### 5. Comparing AI Chatbots (20 minutes)
- Students form small groups, each interacting with a different AI chatbot.
- Groups evaluate strengths, weaknesses, and reliability.
- Share findings with the class using **Padlet or Miro** to compile responses visually.

### 6. The Evolution of AI: From Rule-Based Systems to Deep Learning (30 minutes)
- Lecture on the historical development of AI:
  - Early rule-based systems
  - Introduction of machine learning
  - Rise of neural networks and deep learning
  - Current state of generative AI
- Discussion on key breakthroughs and paradigm shifts.
- Students use **Slack or a shared Google Doc** to ask live questions and summarize key takeaways.

### 7. AI Ethics and Bias (30 minutes)
- Introduction to ethical challenges in AI.
- Case study: AI bias in hiring, criminal justice, and content moderation.
- Group activity: Students propose strategies to mitigate bias in AI systems.
- Use **Miro or Jamboard** to collaboratively map out proposed solutions.

### 8. Hands-On AI Experimentation Using Collaborative Platforms (20 minutes)
- Students engage with AI tools to generate content based on specific prompts.
- AI-generated content is uploaded to **Perusall or Google Docs**, where AI itself will summarize and comment on student reflections.
- Compare AI-generated outputs and discuss patterns and biases.
- AI tools may be used to generate automated critiques of student-generated content.

### 9. Q&A and Discussion (15 minutes)
- Open the floor for student questions and reflections.
- Summarize key takeaways from the session.
