## Overview
This session delves into potential futures shaped by advances in artificial intelligence, including artificial general intelligence, singularity, and transhumanism. Students will engage in speculative scenarios, ethical discussions, and creative envisioning of future AI applications.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concepts of artificial general intelligence, singularity, and transhumanism.
- Critically analyze speculative futures shaped by advanced AI.
- Creatively envision and articulate future applications and implications of AI.

## Materials Needed
- Projector and screen for presentations
- Internet access for research and collaborative activities
- Laptops or mobile devices for interactive sessions
- Online collaborative tools (Google Docs, Padlet, Miro)

## Schedule

### 1. Opening Poll & Reflection Activity (10 minutes)
- Poll: "Do you view the potential development of superintelligent AI as positive, negative, or mixed? Explain briefly."
- Brief class discussion about responses.

### 2. Review of Previous Session (10 minutes)
- Recap key points from Week 9 (AI in Decision-Making).

### 3. Lecture: The Future of AI (25 minutes)
- Exploration of emerging trends and technologies in AI.
- Introduction to concepts: AGI, technological singularity, and transhumanism.

### 4. Group Activity: Speculative AI Scenarios (30 minutes)
- Students work in groups to analyze speculative AI scenarios:
  - Positive scenarios (medical breakthroughs, global problem-solving).
  - Negative scenarios (loss of control, unemployment, ethical dilemmas).
- Presentations of scenario analyses.

### 5. Interactive Discussion: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Singularity (25 minutes)
- Discussion of AGI's implications and singularity.
- Analyze potential benefits and existential risks.

### 6. Ethical Exploration: Transhumanism (20 minutes)

- Debate ethical limits and societal impact.

### 7. Hands-on Activity: Imagining Future AI Applications (20 minutes)
- Creative session where students propose innovative AI applications for future societal needs.
- Share ideas through collaborative platforms.

### 8. Q&A and Open Discussion (5 minutes)
- Address questions, reflections, or further topics of interest.

### 9. Closing and Assignment Overview (5 minutes)
- Summary of session highlights.
- Explanation of upcoming assignments.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Speculative Scenario Analysis
- Write a detailed analysis (1-2 pages) of one speculative AI scenario discussed in class, exploring its plausibility, potential impacts, and ethical dimensions.

### Assignment 2: Reflection Journal
- Reflect on the future of AI as discussed in class. Address your hopes, concerns, and questions regarding AI's trajectory.
