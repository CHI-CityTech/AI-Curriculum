## Overview
This class session serves as an introduction to the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The goal is to familiarize students with the fundamental concepts, history, and impact of AI on various disciplines. This session will also outline the structure of the course and provide an overview of key topics that will be covered.

## Learning Objectives
- Define and describe the basic concepts of AI.
- Analyze the historical development of AI and its impact on society.
- Examine the interdisciplinary nature of AI.
- Outline course expectations, structure, and key topics.
- Reflect on the nature of intelligence and how it applies to both humans and machines.
- Evaluate the capabilities and limitations of different AI content generation tools.

## Materials Needed
- Projector and screen for presentation
- Slide deck: "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence"
- Access to AI tools for demonstration (e.g., ChatGPT, JasperAI, Writesonic, Copy.AI, Rytr, HubSpot, etc.)

## Schedule

### 1. AI Baseline Poll (15 minutes)
- Distribute and have students complete the AI Baseline Poll.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: AI in Daily Life
**Due Date:** Next class session  
**Instructions:** Write a 1-2 page reflection on how AI impacts your daily life. Include specific examples and consider both positive and negative aspects. 

### Assignment 2: Key AI Milestones
**Due Date:** Next class session  
**Instructions:** Research a key milestone in the history of AI and write a brief summary (300-500 words) explaining its significance, starting with Alan Turing’s contributions if relevant. Be prepared to discuss your findings in the next class.

### Assignment 3: AI Tool Exploration
**Due Date:** Next class session  
**Instructions:** Explore an AI content generation tool (e.g., ChatGPT, JasperAI, Writesonic, Copy.AI, or Rytr). Write a short summary (200-300 words) describing your experience, including how the tool works, what content it generated, and its potential applications.

### Assignment 4: Defining Intelligence
**Due Date:** Next class session  
**Instructions:** Reflect on the class discussion about intelligence and write a brief essay (300-500 words) describing your personal definition of intelligence. Consider the symmetries between human and machine intelligence.

### Assignment 5: AI Hallucinations Analysis
**Due Date:** Next class session  
**Instructions:** Using one of the AI content generation tools, intentionally ask it a factual question with an incorrect assumption. Document whether the AI corrected the information or generated a hallucination, and provide a short reflection on the implications of AI-generated errors.
