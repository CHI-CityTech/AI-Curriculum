## Lesson Plan for Week 5: AI in Media & Creativity

### Topic
AI-generated Art, Deepfakes, Storytelling, and Music Composition

### Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe different ways AI is used to generate creative media.
- Critically evaluate the ethical implications of AI-generated media, including deepfakes.
- Create original content using AI tools.

### Class Structure

#### 1. Introduction & Discussion (10 minutes)
- Brief introduction to AI-generated media, deepfakes, and creative applications.
- Interactive poll: "Have you encountered AI-generated content? What was your experience?"
- Quick share from a few students based on their responses.

#### 2. Lecture & Examples: AI in Creative Media (20 minutes)
- Overview of AI applications in creative fields: visual arts, music, literature, and filmmaking.
- Examination of examples:
  - AI-generated artwork (MidJourney, Stable Diffusion)
  - AI-generated music compositions
  - AI-driven storytelling and interactive narratives
- Short demonstration clips of each type.

#### 3. Group Activity: Analyzing Deepfakes (25 minutes)
- Break into groups to analyze case studies involving deepfakes in media.
- Discuss and respond to:
  - Technical aspects of creating deepfakes
  - Societal impacts (misinformation, privacy, ethical concerns)
  - Potential ways to detect and mitigate harm from deepfakes
- Each group presents key points and solutions to the class.

#### 4. Hands-on Activity: Experimenting with AI-Generated Media (30 minutes)
- Students explore and experiment with accessible AI media-generation tools:
  - Text-to-image generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion, MidJourney)
  - AI music composition platforms (e.g., AIVA, Soundraw)
  - AI writing/storytelling assistants (e.g., ChatGPT, Sudowrite)
- Students generate their own creative pieces and briefly share their results and reflections.

#### 5. Ethical Reflection and Class Discussion (20 minutes)
- Facilitated discussion on ethical concerns raised by AI-generated media.
- Questions to address:
  - "What responsibilities do creators have when using AI-generated content?"
  - "Should AI-generated art be considered equal to human-generated art? Why or why not?"

#### 6. Closing and Assignment Overview (10 minutes)
- Summarize key takeaways.
- Introduce next week's topic and assignment related to AI in everyday life.

### Homework
- **Reflection Journal Entry:** Discuss the ethical implications and personal insights gained from creating or interacting with AI-generated media.
- **Media Analysis Assignment:** Find and critique a specific example of AI-generated media, addressing its technical and ethical dimensions.

### Assessment
- Evaluation based on the depth of ethical insights, engagement in hands-on activity, and clarity of expression in assignments.
