## Overview
This session introduces core concepts of AI ethics and prepares students for deeper ethical analysis later in the semester. Students explore sample ethical frameworks, examine cross-cultural regulatory differences, and begin identifying potential case study topics for future investigation.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand key principles and values in AI ethics (fairness, accountability, transparency, etc.).
- Compare international approaches to AI regulation, particularly the EU AI Ethics Guidelines.
- Analyze example ethical dilemmas in AI.
- Begin identifying possible case study topics.

## Materials Needed
- Slides on AI ethical principles
- EU AI Ethics Guidelines overview (linked below)
- Printed or digital ethical scenario prompts
- Small group workspace (Google Docs, LMS, etc.)

## Schedule

### 1. Opening Prompt & Reflection (10 minutes)

### 5. Discussion: Global Perspectives on AI Ethics (20 minutes)
- Introduce and contrast the EU AI Ethics Guidelines with U.S. and other regional approaches.
- What values are prioritized? How do protections differ?

### 6. Case Exploration Workshop (30 minutes)
- Students explore potential case studies using news stories, articles, or instructor-provided examples.
- Begin thinking about which cases they might want to explore further in Week 7.

### 7. Q&A and Assignment Preview (10 minutes)
- Instructor introduces the structure of the upcoming AI Ethics Case Study (assigned in Week 7).
- Answer initial questions and explain how todayâ€™s material will build toward that assignment.

### 8. Exit Reflection (10 minutes)
- Prompt: "Which ethical value do you think is most important in AI? Why?"
- Brief written response, collected or submitted via LMS.

## Assignments
- **Previewed this week:** AI Ethics Case Study Assignment (to be officially assigned in Week 7)
- Students should begin identifying a potential ethical case and reviewing examples from the news or research.
- Students will bring their selected case study and draft notes for discussion in Week 7 before writing begins.
