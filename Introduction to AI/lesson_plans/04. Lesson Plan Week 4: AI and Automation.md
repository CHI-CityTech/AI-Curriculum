## Lesson Plan for Week 4: AI & Automation

### Topic
AI in Robotics, Self-Driving Cars, and Job Displacement

### Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain how AI is integrated into robotics and automation.
- Identify key technological and ethical considerations of self-driving cars.
- Evaluate the impact of AI-driven automation on jobs and employment.

### Class Structure

#### 1. Introduction (15 minutes)
- Brief overview of the day's topics: Robotics, Autonomous Vehicles, and Job Automation.
- Interactive poll: "Would you feel safe riding in a self-driving car? Why or why not?"
- Quick discussion based on poll responses.

#### 2. Lecture: AI in Robotics (20 minutes)
- Overview of AI applications in industrial and service robots.
- Real-world examples: warehouse robots (e.g., Amazon Robotics), drones, robotic surgery.
- Video demonstration: Short clip showcasing robots in action.

#### 3. Activity: Self-Driving Cars Case Study (30 minutes)
- Students break into groups to analyze a specific case study on self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla, Waymo, or Uber autonomous vehicle testing).
- Groups discuss and prepare responses addressing:
  - Technological advancements and current limitations
  - Ethical dilemmas (e.g., liability, safety, ethical decision-making in accidents)
  - Regulatory and societal acceptance
- Each group briefly shares their findings and perspectives with the class.

#### 4. Interactive Discussion: AI & Job Displacement (25 minutes)
- Guided discussion on how AI and automation are impacting various industries (manufacturing, retail, transportation).
- Explore potential future scenarios and what jobs might look like in 10-20 years.
- Debate: "Is AI-driven job displacement a net positive or negative for society?" with students divided into two sides for structured arguments.

#### 5. Hands-on Activity: Exploring AI Automation Tools (20 minutes)
- Students use simple online simulations or interactive tools (e.g., Google's Quick, Draw!, or Teachable Machine) to understand the basics of automation and pattern recognition.
- Reflection on how similar systems might replace or augment certain human tasks.

#### 6. Closing Reflection (10 minutes)
- Individual writing activity: "Reflect on a job you or someone you know has held. How could automation impact this job positively or negatively?"
- Submission of reflection as part of the "AI Reflection Journal."

### Homework
- **Reflection:** Complete and submit the reflection started in class.
- **Reading:** Assigned article on AI and future job markets (provided as OER).

### Assessment
- AI Reflection Journal entries will be graded on depth of reflection, clear articulation of ideas, and engagement with class content.
