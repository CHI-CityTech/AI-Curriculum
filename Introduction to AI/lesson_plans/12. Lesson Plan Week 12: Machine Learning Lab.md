## Overview
This session introduces students to collaborative machine learning using a no-code platform (Teachable Machine). Students will gain practical experience setting up and initially training machine learning models, with activities continued outside of class as an extended assignment.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the workflow for creating and initiating no-code machine learning models.
- Collaboratively set up and train basic machine learning projects using Teachable Machine.
- Reflect critically on ethical considerations in deploying AI models.

## Materials Needed
- Projector and screen for demonstrations
- Laptops or desktops for practical lab work
- Internet access for accessing Teachable Machine ([https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/))
- Online collaborative tools (Google Docs, Padlet)

## Schedule

### 1. Opening Poll & Reflection Activity (10 minutes)
- Quick poll: "What do you think is the most important factor when developing AI models? (Accuracy, Ethical Responsibility, Transparency, User-Friendliness)"
- Brief discussion of poll results.

### 2. Review of Previous Session (10 minutes)
- Summary of key insights from Week 11 (Emerging Technologies).

### 3. Lecture: Introduction to No-Code Machine Learning (20 minutes)
- Explanation of no-code machine learning concepts.
- Demonstration of Teachable Machine capabilities and interface.

### 4. Hands-On Lab: Setting Up Models with Teachable Machine (40 minutes)
- Guided session to set up image or sound classification models.
- Demonstration of capturing or uploading data, labeling, and training the models.

### 5. Initial Training and Evaluation Activity (30 minutes)
- Students train initial models using provided or student-generated datasets.
- Preliminary testing and documentation of model performance.

### 6. Group Reflection and Initial Findings (20 minutes)
- Each group briefly shares model outcomes, challenges, and initial learnings.
- Class discussion on observed trends and next steps.

### 7. Ethical Discussion: Responsible AI Implementation (10 minutes)
- Guided discussion on fairness, bias, transparency, and accountability in no-code ML contexts.

### 8. Q&A and Troubleshooting Session (5 minutes)
- Clarify immediate issues or queries related to the lab activities.

### 9. Closing and Assignment Overview (5 minutes)
- Summary of session highlights and explanation of homework expectations.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Extended Machine Learning Project
- Continue developing your model started in class with Teachable Machine. Submit a detailed report including dataset choices, training steps, evaluation outcomes, and ethical reflections (2-3 pages).

### Assignment 2: Reflection Journal
- Reflect on your experiences during the no-code lab session. Discuss any surprises, key learnings, and ongoing ethical considerations.
