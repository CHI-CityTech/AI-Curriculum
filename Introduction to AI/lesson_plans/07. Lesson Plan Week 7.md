## Overview
This session examines the ethical challenges posed by AI, with a special focus on bias, fairness, and how AI systems can unintentionally perpetuate stereotypes. Students will analyze real-world cases, engage in debates, and collaboratively propose solutions.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify sources and types of bias in AI datasets and models.
- Critically analyze the ethical implications of AI bias.
- Engage in informed debates about fairness and bias in AI systems.
- Propose actionable solutions to mitigate AI bias.

## Materials Needed
- Projector and screen for presentations
- Internet access for accessing case studies
- Laptops or mobile devices for group research and collaboration
- Online collaborative tools (Google Docs, Miro, Padlet)

## Schedule

### 1. Opening Poll & Reflection Activity (10 minutes)
- Quick poll: "Have you ever encountered biased or unfair AI behavior? Share an example."
- Brief class discussion summarizing poll insights.

### 2. Review of Previous Session (10 minutes)
- Recap of key insights from Week 6 (AI in Everyday Life).

### 3. Lecture: Introduction to AI Bias and Fairness (20 minutes)
- Overview of bias types: dataset bias, algorithmic bias, societal bias.
- Real-world examples illustrating the impact of biased AI systems.

### 4. Case Study Analysis: Bias in AI Datasets (30 minutes)
- Students examine specific cases, such as facial recognition inaccuracies, biased hiring algorithms, or healthcare disparities.
- Analyze causes, consequences, and potential mitigation strategies.
- Groups share key insights and discuss broader implications.

### 5. Debate Activity: Does AI Reinforce Stereotypes? (30 minutes)
- Structured class debate:
  - Group A: Argues AI reinforces stereotypes.
  - Group B: Argues AI helps reduce stereotypes.
- Guided discussion and summary of key arguments.

### 6. Group Workshop: Proposing Solutions to AI Bias (30 minutes)
- Small groups brainstorm practical strategies to address bias in AI.
- Solutions may include technological, regulatory, educational, or cultural approaches.
- Group presentations summarizing proposed solutions.

### 7. Ethical Frameworks Discussion (15 minutes)
- Brief overview of ethical frameworks (e.g., fairness, transparency, accountability).
- Interactive discussion on applying these frameworks to mitigate bias.

### 8. Q&A and Open Discussion (10 minutes)
- Open forum for student questions, reflections, or additional topics.

### 9. Closing and Assignment Overview (5 minutes)
- Recap session key points and explain upcoming assignments.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: AI Bias Case Study Reflection
- Choose one case of AI bias discussed in class. Write a 1-2 page reflection analyzing the ethical implications and suggesting potential solutions.

### Assignment 2: Ethics Debate Summary
- Write a concise summary (300-500 words) capturing key points from the debate, including arguments from both sides and personal reflections on the issue.
