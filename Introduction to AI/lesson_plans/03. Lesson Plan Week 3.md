## Overview

This session builds upon previous discussions by focusing on AI in decision-making, media, and machine learning fundamentals. Students will explore how AI processes information differently from humans, discuss the implications of AI-generated media, and gain hands-on experience with a simple machine learning model.

## Learning Objectives

- Compare human and machine decision-making processes.
- Evaluate AI-generated media and its influence on public perception.
- Understand core concepts of machine learning and how AI models are trained.
- Discuss fairness, bias, and transparency in AI.
- Engage with AI tools to explore model training and classification.

## Materials Needed

- Projector and screen for presentation
- Access to AI-generated vs. human-created media samples (articles, music, videos)
- Laptops or mobile devices for AI model training activity
- Online collaboration tools (e.g., Miro, Google Docs, Perusall, Jupyter Notebook)
- Pre-built datasets for machine learning activity

## Schedule

### 1. Opening Poll & Reflection Activity (10 minutes)

- **Online Poll:** Students respond to a quick question via **Google Forms, Padlet, or Poll Everywhere**:
  - "Would you trust an AI to make a life-or-death medical decision? Why or why not?"
  - "Can AI-generated news be as credible as human journalism?"
  - "What are the key factors that make AI decision-making different from human judgment?"
- **Live Response Discussion:** Briefly review poll responses and highlight major themes.
- **Attendance Check:** Participation in the poll serves as an organic way to confirm student presence.

### 2. Review of Previous Session (15 minutes)

- Recap key takeaways from Session 2.
- Address any lingering questions.

### 3. Student Reflections on Assignments (20 minutes)

- Students present insights from their AI chatbot comparisons and ethical dilemmas.
- Use **Google Docs or Perusall** for collaborative discussion and peer review.

### 4. AI in Decision-Making: Human vs. Machine (25 minutes)

- **Lecture:** How AI approaches decision-making (logic, probability, pattern recognition vs. human intuition and context awareness).
- **Case Study:** AI in medical diagnostics vs. human doctors.
- **Activity:** Students debate a scenario where AI must make a critical decision (e.g., self-driving car ethics).

### 5. AI in Media: Generated vs. Curated Content (20 minutes)

- **Comparison Activity:** Students analyze AI-generated vs. human-written news articles, music, and art.
- Use **Padlet or Miro** to track differences in tone, accuracy, and engagement.
- **Discussion:** What are the implications of AI-generated media for society?

### 6. Machine Learning Fundamentals (30 minutes)

- **Lecture:** Overview of machine learning, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, and classification models.
- **Demonstration:** Walk through a basic machine learning pipeline.

### 7. Bias, Fairness, and Transparency in AI (30 minutes)

- **Group Discussion:** Where does bias in AI originate?
- **Activity:** Students examine real-world examples of AI bias (e.g., biased hiring algorithms, facial recognition issues).
- **Collaborative Work:** Propose strategies to improve fairness and transparency using **Miro or Google Docs**.

### 8. Hands-On Experiment: Training a Simple AI Model (30 minutes)

- **Guided Exercise:** Students work in teams to train a small AI model using a pre-built dataset.
- Use **Jupyter Notebook or Teachable Machine** to train a classifier and analyze results.
- Discuss limitations and practical applications of machine learning.

### 9. Q&A and Discussion (15 minutes)

- Open floor for student questions and reflections.
- Summarize key takeaways from the session.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: AI Decision-Making Analysis

**Due Date:** Next class session  
**Instructions:** Choose a case study (e.g., AI in healthcare, finance, self-driving cars). Write a 500-word analysis comparing human vs. AI decision-making and evaluating its impact.

### Assignment 2: Media & AI

**Due Date:** Next class session  
**Instructions:** Find an AI-generated article, song, or image. Compare it with a human-created counterpart and write a 1-page reflection on its differences, strengths, and weaknesses.

### Assignment 3: Understanding Machine Learning

**Due Date:** Next class session  
**Instructions:** Research a real-world application of machine learning (e.g., recommendation systems, fraud detection). Write a 300-500 word summary explaining how it works and why it matters.
