# Week 4 Assignment: Ethics Case Exploration Brief

**Due:** Before Class Session 7  
**Submission:** Include as a labeled entry in your AI Reflection Journal

## Overview
This short, low-stakes assignment prepares you for the AI Ethics Case Study project (officially assigned in Week 7). Your goal is to identify and briefly explore a real-world example of an ethical issue involving artificial intelligence. This entry will help you participate meaningfully in the Week 7 discussion and support your development of the longer case study.

## Instructions
Choose a news article, academic paper, podcast, or report that presents a real or hypothetical AI system with ethical implications. Then respond to the following prompts in 300–500 words:

1. **AI Technology Involved**  
   What does the system or application do? Where or how is it used?

2. **Ethical Issues Raised**  
   What key ethical concerns are presented? Examples: bias, fairness, privacy, misinformation, labor, surveillance, etc.

3. **Stakeholders Affected**  
   Who is impacted by this technology? Consider individuals, communities, companies, governments, etc.

4. **Your Initial Reaction**  
   Share your personal thoughts or emotional responses. What do you find troubling, surprising, or justifiable?

5. **Global Context (Optional but Encouraged)**  
   How might this case be handled differently under the EU AI Ethics Guidelines compared to U.S. or other regional frameworks?

## Format
- Submit this entry as part of your **AI Reflection Journal** and clearly label it as:
  `Week 4 – Ethics Case Exploration Brief`
- You will bring this case with you to class in Week 7 for in-depth discussion and further development.

## Purpose
- Begin thinking critically about real-world AI systems and their ethical dimensions.
- Identify a case you may use for your longer Ethics Case Study.
- Connect early ethical insights to global frameworks like the [EU AI Ethics Guidelines](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai).

## Evaluation
This brief is exploratory and informal. It will not be graded for correctness but should demonstrate thoughtful engagement, relevance to AI ethics, and personal reflection.
