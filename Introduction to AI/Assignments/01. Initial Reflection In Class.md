# Initial In-Class Reflection Assignment & Journal Setup (Week 1)

## Overview
This assignment, conducted during the first class session, serves as a starting point for your exploration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Your initial reflection will capture your current understanding, perceptions, and expectations about AI. This baseline will later be revisited at the end of the semester to measure your learning and growth. Additionally, the class will collectively set up a journaling environment to organize and track reflections throughout the semester.

## Objectives
- Establish a baseline understanding of your current knowledge and perceptions of AI.
- Identify initial thoughts, questions, or concerns about AI.
- Clarify your personal learning goals and expectations for the course.
- Set up a consistent and accessible journaling environment for ongoing reflection.

## Part 1: Reflection Prompt
During the first class session, write a reflective essay (approximately 300 words) addressing the following areas, considering ethical, practical, and emotional dimensions:

1. **Your Definition of AI:**
   - How do you currently define or understand Artificial Intelligence?

2. **Experiences and Interactions:**
   - Describe any personal experiences or interactions you've had with AI or AI-powered technologies (e.g., chatbots, virtual assistants, recommendation systems).
   - Reflect on how these interactions made you feel, including any emotional responses (positive, negative, neutral).

3. **Perceptions and Thoughts:**
   - What do you believe are the potential benefits of AI?
   - What concerns or potential risks do you associate with AI?
   - How do you perceive AI's current or future impact on society?

4. **Goals and Expectations:**
   - What specific goals or expectations do you have for this course?
   - Are there particular questions or topics you're especially interested in exploring?

## Part 2: Journal Setup (Class Activity)
After completing your initial reflection, the class will collaboratively set up a journaling environment under the instructor's guidance. Potential platforms include Google Docs, Microsoft OneNote, or Notion. Your instructor will determine the best platform for your class. 

### Setup Steps:
- Follow the instructor's demonstration to set up your personal digital journal.
- Clearly label your journal document (e.g., "AI Reflection Journal - [Your Name]").
- Upload or copy your initial reflection into this journaling environment.

## Time Allocation
- Reflection Writing: Approximately **20-25 minutes**
- Journal Setup Activity: Approximately **15 minutes**

## Submission Guidelines
- Complete and submit your reflection by the end of the initial class session.
- Ensure your journal is correctly set up and contains your initial reflection. This reflection will be revisited for comparison with your final reflection in Week 15.

## Evaluation Note
This initial reflection is exploratory and speculative. It is intended as a baseline for your learning journey and does not have correct or incorrect responses. The emphasis is on capturing your genuine initial perspectives, ethical considerations, practical insights, and emotional responses to AI.
