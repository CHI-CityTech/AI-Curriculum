# Week 7 Assignment: AI Ethics Case Study

**Due:** Extended version due Week 8  
**Submission:** Upload as a standalone document (PDF, Word, or shared Google Doc link)

## Overview
Building on your Week 4 Ethics Case Exploration Brief and the in-class discussion in Week 7, this assignment asks you to write a more detailed ethical analysis of a real-world AI case. Your goal is to critically examine the ethical implications of the AI system using one or more ethical frameworks, explore the consequences of ethical noncompliance, and propose mitigation strategies or solutions.

## Instructions
Using the case you prepared for discussion (or a new one with instructor approval), write a 3–5 page paper (approx. 900–1,500 words) that includes the following:

### 1. Case Description
- Clearly explain the AI system, its function, and its use context.
- Provide relevant background and cite your sources.

### 2. Ethical Analysis
- Identify the core ethical issues and affected stakeholders.
- Apply at least one ethical framework (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics).
- Reference the EU AI Ethics Guidelines and compare to U.S. or other approaches where appropriate.
- Address the **potential or actual harm** caused by ethical noncompliance in the case.

### 3. Multiple Viewpoints (Required)
- Analyze the case from **at least two different stakeholder perspectives**, such as users, developers, marginalized communities, or policymakers.
- Consider how each group may experience or evaluate the situation differently.

### 4. Mitigation and Solutions
- Propose actionable steps to reduce harm or improve ethical compliance.
- This could include policy recommendations, design interventions, educational initiatives, or broader societal strategies.

### 5. Reflection (150–250 words)
- What did you learn through the writing and discussion process?
- How did your thinking shift since Week 4?

## Formatting Guidelines
- 12 pt font, double-spaced, with clear section headings.
- Use MLA or APA for all citations.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Clarity and relevance of case selection
- Depth of ethical reasoning and application of frameworks
- Inclusion and balance of multiple perspectives
- Insightful discussion of harm, consequences, and mitigation strategies
- Writing clarity and citation accuracy

## Resources
- [EU AI Ethics Guidelines](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai)
- Your Reflection Journal and Week 4 Brief
- Notes and resources from Week 7 discussion

This assignment serves as a bridge between critical reflection and ethical reasoning. It is your opportunity to take a thoughtful stance on how AI should—or should not—be implemented in real-world settings, and how ethical challenges can be responsibly addressed.
