# Final Project Assignment Guidelines.

## Overview
The final project is an opportunity for students to apply key concepts learned throughout the course in a practical or creative AI-focused project. Students can choose to develop a project individually or collaborate in small groups (2-3 students per group).

## Project Objectives
- Clearly define and address a practical problem or creatively explore an innovative application using AI.
- Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of AI concepts, methodologies, and technologies discussed in class.
- Critically engage with ethical considerations relevant to your project's domain.

## Project Timeline
- **Introduction to Project:** Week 4 (recommended for adequate development time)
- **Project Proposal Due:** Week 6
- **Mid-Project Check-In:** Week 9
- **Final Presentations:** Week 13

## Deliverables
- **Project Proposal (Week 6):**
  - A 1-page document outlining your project concept, goals, expected outcomes, and team members (if applicable).

- **Mid-Project Progress Report (Week 9):**
  - A brief 1-2 page report detailing current progress, challenges encountered, and next steps.

- **Final Presentation (Week 13):**
  - A concise 5-7 minute presentation clearly describing your project, demonstrating outcomes, and reflecting on key learnings.

- **Final Documentation (Week 13):**
  - Comprehensive documentation including:
    - Project Overview
    - Objectives and Goals
    - Description of AI methods and tools used
    - Outcomes and analysis
    - Ethical considerations
    - Reflections on the development process and learnings

## Example Project Ideas

- **AI-powered Personal Assistant**
  - Scope: Develop a simple AI assistant to help with task scheduling, reminders, or productivity enhancement.
