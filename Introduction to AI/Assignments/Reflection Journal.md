# Assignment: AI Reflection Journal (Weeks 1-15)

## Overview
The AI Reflection Journal is a continuous assignment designed to help you deepen your understanding of artificial intelligence by regularly reflecting on course topics, activities, and your personal learning experiences throughout the semester.

## Objectives
- Promote critical thinking and self-assessment about AI concepts and implications.
- Track your personal growth and shifts in perspective regarding AI over time.
- Encourage meaningful connections between course materials and personal or professional interests.
- Develop proficiency in integrating AI tools within standard editing and revision processes.

## Assignment Details

### Weekly Reflections
Each week, following the class session, you will write a brief reflection (approximately 250-300 words) addressing the following:
- **Summary:** Briefly summarize the key concepts or activities from the week's session.
- **Insights:** Highlight at least one significant insight or realization from the session.
- **Connections:** Describe connections between the session's content and your prior knowledge, experiences, or future goals.
- **Questions or Concerns:** Identify any remaining questions, uncertainties, or areas you want to explore further.

### AI-Assisted Feedback and Revision
After completing each weekly reflection, use an AI tool to generate a response or provide feedback on your reflection. Experiment with different AI platforms each week (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Bing AI). Cite the AI platform clearly in your document.

You should keep a clear record in your document including:
- Your original reflection.
- The AI-generated response or feedback.
- Your revised final version of the reflection incorporating insights from the AI response.

### Example AI Prompts
- "Given the reflection I've written, what additional questions should I consider exploring?"
- "Provide constructive feedback on my reflectionâ€”are there areas where I can deepen my analysis?"
- "Suggest additional connections or examples relevant to the reflection I've provided."
- "Identify potential misconceptions or areas needing further clarity in my reflection."
- "How can the insights in my reflection be applied practically in real-world scenarios?"

### Milestone Reflections
At specific milestones (Weeks 5, 10, and 15), you will write more detailed reflections (approximately 500-600 words), focusing on:
- Your cumulative learning up to that point.
- Key shifts or developments in your understanding of AI.
- Critical examination of your evolving opinions about ethical, social, and practical implications of AI.

## Submission Format
- Maintain your reflections, AI-generated responses, and revised reflections clearly within a single digital document, marking each weekly entry distinctly.
- Use standard formatting: 12-point font, single spacing, clear headings (Week #).
- Submit milestone reflections separately on designated submission dates via the course platform.
- Clearly cite all AI tools used, including the name of the tool and date of use.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your Reflection Journal will be assessed on:
- **Depth of Reflection:** Demonstrates thoughtful, critical engagement with course content and personal growth.
- **Clarity and Coherence:** Clearly written, organized, and easy to follow.
- **Consistency and Completeness:** Regular weekly submissions and thorough coverage of required topics.
- **Integration:** Effective connections made between course topics, personal experiences, professional interests, and AI-generated responses.
- **AI Integration:** Thoughtful engagement with AI responses, clearly cited and meaningfully integrated into your reflection and revision processes.

## Timeline
- Weekly entries due within 2 days after each class session.
- Milestone reflections due:
  - **Week 5 Milestone:** End of Week 5
  - **Week 10 Milestone:** End of Week 10
  - **Final Milestone (Week 15):** End of Week 15
