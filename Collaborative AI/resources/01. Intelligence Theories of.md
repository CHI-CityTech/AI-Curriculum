# Major Historical Models of Intelligence (Pre-Turing Overview)

This overview outlines the dominant historical models of intelligence prior to the mid-20th century. Each model reflects a different cultural, philosophical, or technological approach to understanding what intelligence is, how it functions, and where it resides.

## 1. Intelligence as Divine Essence or Animating Force

**Core Idea**:  
Intelligence is a spiritual or vital force, often granted or imbued by a deity or higher power.

**Context**:  
Ancient mythology, sacred texts, animistic and early philosophical traditions.

**Examples**:
- **The Golem** (Jewish folklore): An animated figure brought to life through sacred ritual and divine words.
- **Hephaestus's golden automata** (Greek myth): Self-moving, human-like assistants created by the god of craftsmanship.
- **Qi** (Chinese philosophy): A vital force flowing through the universe; intelligence as part of cosmic balance.

**Implications**:
- Intelligence is *not separable* from the being or soul.
- Typically *not observable or testable*—its presence is assumed through animation or behavior.
- Human intelligence is often framed as a reflection of divine or universal intelligence.

## 2. Intelligence as Rational Thought (Reason)

**Core Idea**:  
Intelligence is the capacity for abstract reasoning, logic, and understanding universals—what separates humans from animals.

**Context**:  
Classical Greek philosophy.

**Examples**:
- **Plato**: Intelligence (*logos*) as the rational part of the soul, connected to eternal forms.
- **Aristotle**: *Nous* (intellect) as the highest faculty, enabling humans to understand causes, purposes, and ethics.

**Implications**:
- Intelligence is internal and abstract.
- Rational thinking is the highest form of intelligence.
- Sets the foundation for Western philosophical and educational models.

## 3. Intelligence as Ordered Knowledge

**Core Idea**:  
Intelligence is the structured understanding of divine or moral order; a gift that allows humans to approach truth and virtue.

**Context**:  
Medieval scholasticism, Islamic philosophy, Christian theology.

**Examples**:
- **Augustine**: Human understanding is a flawed mirror of divine omniscience.
- **Aquinas**: Reason is a tool for discovering and aligning with divine law.

**Implications**:
- Intelligence is evaluated by *moral and spiritual alignment*, not just functionality.
- Intelligence is *hierarchical*, with divine intelligence at the top.

## 4. Intelligence as Mechanical Function

**Core Idea**:  
Intelligence (or its appearance) can be mimicked or generated by mechanical systems; mind and machine may not be so different.

**Context**:  
Enlightenment and early modern science.

**Examples**:
- **Descartes**: Animals are automata; only humans possess rational souls—but behavior can be mechanized.
- **La Mettrie** (*Man a Machine*): Argues that human cognition is itself a mechanical function.
- **Automata**: Vaucanson’s duck (simulated digestion), The Turk (chess-playing automaton).

**Implications**:
- Begins the split between intelligence and spirit/soul.
- Intelligence becomes observable, engineerable.
- Sparks public fascination with lifelike machines.

## 5. Intelligence as Symbolic Representation

**Core Idea**:  
Intelligence is the manipulation of symbols and execution of rules—deterministic, abstract, and formalizable.

**Context**:  
19th–early 20th century developments in logic, mathematics, and early computing.

**Examples**:
- **Boole, Frege, Peirce**: Formal logic and symbolic reasoning systems.
- **Babbage & Lovelace**: Analytical engine; first concepts of programmable machines.
- **Early computing**: Intelligence defined as rule-based operations over formal structures.

**Implications**:
- Intelligence is *computable*.
- Shifts focus from biology to abstraction.
- Paves the way for Turing and early AI models.

## Bridge to Modern Frameworks

The symbolic and mechanical views of intelligence directly influence:

- **Turing**: Behavioral simulation (The Imitation Game)
- **Wiener (Cybernetics)**: Intelligence as dynamic regulation and feedback
- **Cognitive Science**: Intelligence as information processing
- **BBS**: Intelligence as relational, symmetrical, and distributed

## Guiding Questions

- How did early definitions of intelligence reflect spiritual, cultural, or political needs?
- Which aspects of these models still appear in modern AI discourse?
- What assumptions do these models make about what *can* and *cannot* be intelligent?
