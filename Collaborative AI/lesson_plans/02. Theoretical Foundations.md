#### Lesson Objectives:
- Understand the distinction between AI as a tool and AI as a collaborative partner.
- Explore theoretical frameworks for collaboration between cognitive and computational intelligence.
- Analyze historical and contemporary models of human-machine interaction.

#### Materials:
- Required reading: Excerpts from foundational texts on human-computer interaction and AI agency
- Diagrams of collaboration models (instrumental vs. symmetrical)
- Case studies of AI collaboration in creative and research settings
- Discussion board or collaborative whiteboard (e.g., Miro, Jamboard)

#### Detailed Narrative:
In the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework, artificial intelligence is not regarded merely as a subordinate tool but as a potential co-agent in any cognitive or creative act. This shift requires a redefinition of agency, authorship, and mutual influence. 

We will discuss theoretical shifts from instrumentalism (where tools are acted upon) to co-agency (where partners interact), and the implications of treating AI systems as contributors rather than extensions of human will. This theoretical grounding is critical for future practical work in BBS environments, including mediation mapping and syntax development.

#### Lesson Outline:

**1. Introduction and Recap (10 minutes)**
- Recap of Week 1: Core ideas of BBS and the necessity of balance, blending, and symmetry
- Outline of today's focus on redefining AI roles

**2. Tool vs. Partner: Shifting the Paradigm (25 minutes)**
- Instructor-led discussion with visual aids on:
  - Instrumental use of AI (traditional models)
  - Collaborative frameworks (symmetrical agency)
- Discussion prompts:
  - What changes when we think of AI as a partner?
  - Are there limitations or risks to this approach?

**3. Theoretical Frameworks and Historical Context (25 minutes)**
- Overview of relevant thinkers and frameworks:
  - Alan Turing, Norbert Wiener (cybernetics)
  - Donna Haraway (cyborg theory)
  - Bruno Latour (actor-network theory)
- Compare and contrast with BBS philosophy

**4. Case Study Analysis (20 minutes)**
- Students break into small groups to examine short case studies:
  - AI in generative art
  - AI in scientific modeling
  - AI in language and narrative co-writing
- Each group presents a short summary of:
  - How collaboration was structured
  - Whether balance and symmetry were achieved

**5. Reflection and Discussion (10 minutes)**
- Full-class reflection: Can AI ever truly be a partner?
- Prompt for assignment: "Describe a scenario in which a human and an AI collaboratively produce something that neither could produce alone. How would agency and authorship be defined?"

#### Assignments:
- Reading packet on AI agency and co-authorship
- Reflective short essay (2-3 pages) on the week’s prompt
- Optional: Post one example of AI-human collaboration (real or speculative) to the discussion board

#### Assessment:
- Participation in case study analysis and discussion
- Thoughtful articulation in reflection essay
- Engagement with readings and examples provided
