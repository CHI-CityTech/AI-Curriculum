### Course Title:
**Balanced Blended Space (BBS) and Collaborative AI**

### Course Description:
This interdisciplinary course explores the integration of cognitive and computational intelligence through the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework. Students will engage with theoretical and practical applications of artificial intelligence as collaborative partners in creative, experiential, and mediated spaces. The course emphasizes the ethical, cultural, and technological dimensions of AI-human collaboration.
