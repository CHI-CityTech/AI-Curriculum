# **Position Brief: Intelligence-First Framing for Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science**

### **Purpose**
- Provide a speculative framework for discussion on reframing *Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science* around models of intelligence and the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework.
- Explore alignment with the existing *Legal Aspects of Data Science* course and the forthcoming *Collaborative AI* course.
- Offer a conceptual roadmap for coherence across the Data Science curriculum.

### **Rationale: Intelligence as the Foundation for Ethics**
- Every philosophical and ethical system historically arises from how intelligence defines itself (divine, rational, mechanical, computational, relational).
- Data science systems instantiate models of intelligence—how systems perceive, reason, and act—and therefore reproduce these historical assumptions.
- Teaching ethics through intelligence helps students understand not only *what* is right but *why* data systems behave as they do.
- Anchoring the course in intelligence-first reasoning situates ethics at the interface of cognition, computation, and human values.

### **Balanced Blended Space (BBS) Framework**
- Provides a behavioral model for analyzing mediation among **human**, **computational**, and **institutional** intelligences.
- Uses three spaces—**Conceptual**, **Physical**, **Virtual**—to map how ethical imbalance occurs.
- Defines ethical behavior as **balanced mediation** (transparency, reciprocity, and feedback integrity) among interacting intelligences.
- Offers a visual and analytic framework that links abstract ethics to data-system behavior.

### **Curricular Integration**
- **Legal Aspects of Data Science** – addresses compliance and regulation (what is *allowed*).
- **Societal & Ethical Impacts** – addresses behavioral ethics and systemic balance (what is *right* and *sustainable*).
- **Collaborative AI** – addresses co-agency and shared responsibility (how humans and AI act *together*).
- Sequentially, these three courses trace a progression from **external accountability → internal ethics → shared agency.**

### **Reframing Learning Outcomes**
- Outcomes remain unchanged but are interpreted through BBS to emphasize:
  - Identification of ethical issues as systemic imbalances.
  - Connection of societal wellbeing to transitions in models of intelligence.
  - Presentation of case studies that highlight ambiguity and competing values.
  - Linking data, society, and ethics through measurable behavioral outcomes.
  - Communication of complex ethical reasoning across technical and public domains.

### **Pedagogical Advantages**
- Moves ethics instruction from abstract virtue to applied system design.
- Provides a common conceptual language connecting humanistic and computational reasoning.
- Encourages critical thinking about how data systems embody specific models of intelligence.
- Creates continuity with Collaborative AI, preparing students to reason about distributed agency.

### **Next Steps for Discussion**
- Consider recognizing *Societal and Ethical Impacts* as a recommended or de facto prerequisite for *Collaborative AI*.
- Explore brief inclusion of BBS-based diagrams or mapping exercises as cross-course tools.
- Discuss potential faculty collaboration to ensure continuity between legal, ethical, and AI-collaborative curricula.
- Identify opportunities for research or publication on the integration of behavioral ethics in Data Science education.
